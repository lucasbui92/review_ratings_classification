486996,42,These work well and were very easy to purchase.  They came right away.  Very satisfied with my purchase.,5
240190,42,I had this on a trawler for 8 years.  Sold the boat and now buying another one for the next boat.,5
130275,42,Replacement wheels worked great... just what we needed.  Perfect!,5
321957,42,After looking for through many other pumps I decided on this one.  It was very easy to install and fit perfectly with my dishwasher.  Fixed the issue with it not draining and has been working great since installed.,5
382878,42,"Found them, ordered them, received them ... fast !! I have read some reviews that I disagree with. They are not flimsy. The tops on mine are still intact after almost a month. I use them ALL daily. Great price. I have a Farberware coffee maker. Will purchase again if I ever have to. Totally recommend !!",5
695181,42,Fit great and is working after several loads of wash.  Was a little greasy but I think it’s because it was very warm out.,5
150242,42,"This part arrived broken, very disappointed. It’s very upsetting because we were waiting for this part to arrive and finally fix our washer.",1
548798,42,And it didn't even last a year before it quit working,2
98761,42,Fits right in and costs SO much less.  Won't go wrong.  Top might look a little different but it fir right in.,5
257661,42,The lids don’t fit tight enough and pull off while brewing,3
697976,42,This cutting board fits nicely  on my stove and makes it so much easier now when cooking. I can cut up my veggies and so forth right there and just scoot it right into pan. have not tested heat under it so not sure about heat resistance as it asked me.,5
126121,42,it didn't work after taking 2 hours for washer moving and replacement.,1
600476,42,"I received the dishwasher and the box was beat up.  I figured the product would be wrapped safely, but when I got it out of the box, both legs were bent badly and both sides of the door were bent.  I know I should have returned it, but I needed it.  I won't get an appliance through shipping again.<br /><br />I did get it installed after much bending and adjusting, and it seems to work OK.  It's been 3 days now.",2
364448,42,I checked out the different ways to use regular coffee grounds and decided this looked like the most efficient  and effective.  My 1st cup was kind of weak. I added a little more coffee grounds and tamped it down with the back of the scoop and success! A great cup of coffee.  And you can reuse these over and over unlike the foil lids that are one use only. Glad I decided on these.,5
22013,42,[[VIDEOID:87b74cd36db5ed541529a01651a7e932]] I bought this and really liked it but recently this is all it does I've tried to find contact information for the company in order to get assistance but there isn't one.  It was great when it worked,3
678353,42,The wheels and belt are identical to stock but the tensioner is a piece of crap. Still worth the money. Everything is installed and has about 15 loads through the dryer and has been working fine. So far it's fixed my problem but I still have little faith in the tensioner,3
524304,42,This air filter was exactly what would fit on our humidifier.,4
96922,42,"I ordered this timer for my dryer, and it was an exact fit [OEM] it was easy to install and worked properly.. I strongly recommend this supplier.. Thank you..",5
77099,42,"I have very discerning tastes when it comes to water.  Or it could be that my tastebuds are extremely sensitive.  I don’t like any tastes other than water in my water, which is why I buy Ice Mountain bottled water and not Dasani.  Dasani tastes “off” and is very similar to the water out of this filter.  My husband doesn’t notice a difference, but he always mixes it with Crystal Light so I’m sure that could be why.  Everything else about the filter was fine...easy to install, reasonable price, etc...I just can’t deal with the taste being off.",3
108263,42,"We got a Keurig for Christmas and bought a bunch of K cups. They are expensive. We had canned coffee at home so bought this so we could use up the coffee. Even with our Yuban, this measures and makes  perfect cup of coffee.",5
422519,42,"The filter fits. The coffee tastes good, although It tastes good before I started using this filter.  The cost was definitely good. The filters are not individually wrapped, I don’t know enough about filters to know whether or not that’s important.  I appreciate the small business owner and will tell others to support the small businesses.",4
584255,42,No space available between dryer and wall outlet to install.  Product description should have given more information about criteria for installation.,1
231551,42,"It arrived quickly and solved the problem. The circuit closed and allowe energy to flow to the igniter and the gas valve opened, heating the dryer.",5
186542,42,"This fits perfectly, the screen it very lightweight screening, unlike the original, which was very heavy, but it works, it does what it was intended for. I would recommend",5
576360,42,"The ice maker worked great for 4-5 months.  Month 6, though, has been an issue.  It had mechanical difficulties, and I felt Euhomy was unresponsive to my reaching out.  As the week came to a close, I read some reviews about their customer support and wrote a 1-star review.  Shortly after that, they reached out (not even sure if they saw the review), and they 100% made things right.  So I'm changing my review up to a 4-star review (though it was a 5-star for six months, so maybe a 4.5-star review?....had they reached out quicker, it would've stayed 5, but I'm happy at this point).",4
104171,42,Easier to use than I thought they would be.  Really makes the coffee taste better!,5
423008,42,"This product is much larger than I thought, but that is not a bad thing!  It's easy to see, however, it is very hard to slide back and forth.  We have to pull it off the dishwasher and use 2 thumbs to slide to the other slide.  So it could be easier to use.",4
418449,42,"Stylish & Beautiful,  very quiet & contractor said it was easy to install.",5
42718,42,It helps to put the right amount of cream yo your coffee.,5
106244,42,I thought these were easy to put on. They seem very secure.  I've run the dishwasher at least 4 times and haven't had any problems.  I recommend these to extend the life of the dishwasher rack.  They look attractive.,5
515002,42,They went on easy and are holding up well so far.,4
265022,42,I am not sure what has changed. I have ordered this product before and never had problems. This order was different. The filter paper feels different and does not stay tight within the frame. it is pulling away and swelling more than usual. I will not order this same product again.,2
280764,42,Order these and they fit perfectly in my keurig...will definitely order again!,5
555277,42,Very happy with my purchase! Works great this is a replacement for another brand that recently stopped working and this one I believe works better than my previous one. Have used it nonstop for the last three weeks no issues,5
78732,42,This has to be one of the best buys I’ve made in a while. It does what it’s supposed to with zero issues,5
687858,42,Love my new ice maker. Very easy to use. With 3 in our household we have plenty of ice,5
346240,42,"Product arrived with a broken handle. There's a screw that holds both sides of the handle together. Unfortunately, looks like mine is broken and the screw is either stripped or will not go through the broken plastic. Item is NOT eligible for return. Therefore I will probably be pinching my hand every time I go to you in between the parts of a broken handle.",1
193228,42,"I love this thing! I have never had any leaking or issues. The only thing I would caution a buyer on is to make sure that you measure your space!! Especially under the cabinets! It is a big machine so if you're anything like me and lazy, once you find a spot you're not going to move it. I had to get a shelf in my kitchen to make it work, but I wasn't thinking and didn't measure and it didn't fit on my countertop. Be smart and measure all dimensions!",5
72344,42,"I installed this in my Whirlpool refrigerator when my water intake started leaking, and it fixed the problem. With a wrench, some pliers, and a screwdriver, I was able to install this part in under 15 minutes.",5
171284,42,"I bought this hose based upon the picture.  The hose that arrived, seen in my picture, has a fitting on only ONE end, not two as in the Amazon listing picture.  The one fitting that was on there was grey, not black, and looks like it's faded.  Not sure if this is a leftover irregular hose, or what, but it certainly isn't the item I thought I was purchasing.",1
343912,42,Drawer inside is not on a track it just sits in the bottom.,4
365427,42,"My first alcohol burner.  Bought it as an alternate heat source to wood for use in a Solo Stove.  Only used it once so far.  Worked well.  Although I thought it used more fuel (denatured alcohol) than I expected.  Don't really look forward to having to carry along liquid fuel, but it should work well as a backup when no wood or only wet wood can be found.",4
253729,42,Love it other than how loud it is. It looks good and gets the job done.,4
591243,42,Good n looks pretty on the stove,5
383328,42,Better discriptions and pictures would make the hit and miss of finding the right ones on the first try.  Still a great product.,5
518171,42,The product did what it was designed to do.. I would buy again.,5
56807,42,I love this. I love not having to worry with buying the k-cups anymore. And my coffee is always without the grounds thanks to these little guys. Love them.,5
426571,42,5 minute fix and the dishwasher is now working again.,5
682086,42,Awesome purchase - the number of filters for the price was well worth it.,5
659014,42,I like it all. Does the job of keeping my stove clean.,5
461089,42,Sick of running to the box stores searching for the filters that fit! These are perfect fit and are less expensive!,5
404392,42,"getting back  36.80  after  paid  42.99  didn't use returned the next day  ...  needed  temp and humidity control, it was  humidity and dehumidifier control, don't know why it popped up in search engine results.",1
286629,42,I love this product it’s perfect for egg storage and display for the deviled eggs.,5
698387,42,"It's not too expensive, is easy to install, and fits my humidifier. An annual chore completed.",3
646248,42,"I love this ice maker! If you want to make a lot of ice for parties or just love “sonic” type pebble ice cubes, then you’ll love this thing! For what it is, it’s pretty quiet and compact. Definitely recommend this ice maker!",5
292667,42,exactly what I needed.  works perfectly.  Arrived on time.<br />Thank you,5
30510,42,These are a perfect fit for the air filters in your Kitchenaid fridge.  Snap in nicely and they are individually packed so they don’t degrade during storage.<br />The only thing that I was surprised about is that they didn’t come with the ‘freshness’ tabs that co e with the OEM filters.  Other than that. Great fit at a great price.,4
333557,42,It works just like we expected.  I am looking to see how it will work as time goes by but it has been as expected so fa.,5
545420,42,"The machine does a perfectly fine job of making coffee - as others have said there is a fair amount of splashing as it pours the coffee into the cup.  After 2 months of use it has developed an annoying vibration from the lid of the water reservoir when in use - really loud.  One either has to put up with the noise, or press down on the reservoir lid whilst it's brewing. It is freestanding on a granite counter top.  If it didn't vibrate, I would give it 5 stars for ease of use",2
626183,42,Great filter but I don't really get a choice in which one I can use lol,5
554357,42,Can someone say cost effective? We usually spend $70 at Home Depot for two of these things and now we can get 4 for $25. Killer deal.,5
401025,42,"This Replacement is made out of metal, not plastic like the one that comes on the dryer when you purchase it.  Well worth the extra money, this one is comfortable and strong.  It will never break.  If you buy the factory replacement because you are trying to save money, forget it!  The plastic factory handle will break again and you will have spent more than if you just buy this one first.  Not to mention the Aggravation and time you will spend replacing the plastic handle time and time again!<br /><br />This is the only metal replacement on the internet that I could find.  I would gladly of spent even more because I never have to worry about this breaking again.  Wife is happy as well and that is the best thing about this purchase.",5
228897,42,This first time I order this product the strip did not lay flat.  So I was sent the same product and it was the same issue.,2
396499,42,this fixed my problem. The first part was damaged and i received a replacement right away.,5
586760,42,"awesome product, perfect fit. timely delivery. thank You!",5
78210,42,"hard to find item in brick and mortar stores. Glad to find a seller so easily.  Now I am ready each morning for my caffeine, without which, life is not worth living.",5
72188,42,"Product specs are accurate. Fit perfectly, Had it 2 months and no problem.",5
461482,42,Product was as described. Thank you,5
450781,42,Very cheaply made actually came bent in the mail. If it would have been packaged in a small box or a much sturdier envelope that may have not happened unfortunately I received it and not working condition. My money was refunded immediately and I didn't even have to return the product back to the company. Sadly I don't recommend it and unfortunately it's hard to find that exact size for a gas stove that's over 22 years old.,1
619860,42,These are the absolute BEST water filters for the money. I have tried many many Maytag filters and have had to throw them away because of the bad taste. Not these! I have purchased these multiple times in the three pack value size. Definitely worth trying. Best Value!,5
332502,42,Perfect just what I was expecting.,5
692727,42,"unfortunately the machine does not correspond to the parameters indicated on the site, it is for a maximum of 10 pounds, it is the same as our old one, I do not advise taking this car, and even for such an enu.  The seller should be ashamed for his product.",3
288101,42,I’ve used other knock-off brands of reusable filters that work just fine.  These ones aren’t made very well and end up spraying coffee all over the place.,1
306499,42,"Arrived quickly, just what I needed for my old vacuum.",5
9671,42,I have been using this product all winter and it works good. JJ,5
238,42,Not the parts fault. It's designed crappy. Replace this part every 4 months.. $1200 dryer I would expect more. I finally machined my own wheel from aluminum and pressed high rpm beatings to ride on existing arm..,1
211591,42,"UPDATE: It's been four years since I first bought these and one more shelf has just broken. That's a good lifespan for how hard my family is on the shelves. We really load them up. I actually don't know if it's one of these replacements or one of my originals that has now broken, but I'll be ordering another three pack.<br /><br />****<br />These were perfect and are still working well. I'm glad I got this three pack because once I looked over my original ones, I realized another original one was about to break.",5
591858,42,This part fits my whirlpool dishwasher as well as original. That said this is the third top rack wheels I have had to replace. Its a bad design with cheap plastic parts. But this is no fault of this seller. I received this part a day early and have gotten 2 emails from seller to see if  I was satisfied. Can recommend this sellers customer service.,5
455930,42,"What I like most about this container is the sturdiness it provides eggs.  Rather than a styrofoam carton that is often fragile, the Mind Reader protects the egg and allows me to place it in the refrigerator without a concern for placement.  I can stack other items atop the slide-out unit making it more practical.  I can have 3 eggs or 12 eggs in this new container and not have a balance situation.  Often, if I have 3 eggs left, the styrofoam carton becomes unbalanced to one side and it can easily be dropped or possibly fall apart.<br /><br />The Mind Reader Stackable must be hand washed and the price is not inexpensive.  However, I feel it is worth the cost and could possibly make a clever gift.",4
305622,42,Easy to install and look great. Best part is you can’t tell if they get dirty since most of the junk that gets in there is black. Wife loves them and these fit perfect for our older GE stove.,5
699049,42,These carbon filters fit as expected in our Keurig coffee maker. They are identical to the OEM filters that came with the coffee maker. Installation is easy and they provide the same filtering as OEM...at a fraction of the price. I highly recommend these K&J filters.,5
49834,42,"Item installed easily enough but, in less than 3 weeks of use, the part has broken. I'll try  different supplier for the next go around.",1
173072,42,Have had my kegerator built and in use for over 2 years now and this kit was perfect for my conversion.  Still in great use and just needs to be cleaned every once in a while to keep all the bacteria out so buy a cleaning kit with this as well.<br /><br />It is super easy to setup and use.  Could be done in a matter of minutes to be honest.,5
530631,42,"Took some time to install, but, worth the effort",5
567116,42,"This comes with I think 8.  They should let you know an exacto knife would be useful for putting them on, but you don't have to have that (we don't).  These are like teflon - food easily wipes off them even with a large spill.  I scrubbed my stove top till it hurt (me, not the stovetop lol).  I decided no more and found these.  Work fantastic!",5
272625,42,Refrigerator water filters were the ones I needed. Was EZ to install and worked great. Thanks Amazon!,5
387930,42,"I ordered this to attach to the existing drain hose to my dishwasher which was too short, so water kept backing up in my washer and leaving a horrible odor. This hose fixed the problem, however I only needed about a foot length, so there is quite a bit of extra hose under my sink.  I can deal with that a lot better than having to constantly suction out skunk water from the dishwasher!",4
108554,42,Incredibly cheaper than Home Depot ... work like a charm,5
312777,42,"Counterfeit!  The filters received are made in Mexico, not Korea.  Samsung confirmed that these aren't the real deal.  It's insulting to get a fake Samsung filter, but I guess that's why it's 33% off.  Even the label is different.<br /><br />Stay away.",1
651727,42,Well-designed. It works! It does what it says it does. The customer service is excellent for any questions. Highly recommend.,5
360927,42,"It's everything you need to save the heat from your dryer. With the amount of laundry we do, it was such a waste just sending it outside. I have a feeling our power bill will show a major difference; the furnace doesn't come on nearly as often and some days we've been able to air out the house a little. The hose isn't the flimsy plastic type, so it will stand up to removing and reinstalling as the seasons change.",5
577429,42,I saw video to install. it is fit for GE,5

290024,42,"I had the horrible shrieking squeak coming out of my dryer for the last week or two (on and off light squeaks for a year). It worked to stop the squeaking but I had two complaints, the belt that came with it was too short (no problem, mine was fine) and it only came with 4 support rollers but my dryer has 5 (no problem, just cleaned up, oiled and reused one of the old ones). If it weren't for those two things it would have neeb 5 stars. I believe my squeak would have been solved by breaking the dryer down and cleaning and oiling the shafts that the idler and rollers ride on, but I'm happy with the peace of mind of having new parts. All parts seem very high quality as well.",4
539880,42,"The choice is between the original all-plastic wheels that failed after 4 years, or trying ones with metal axles. If these last more than 4 years then I'll have made a good choice.",5
187215,42,"2nd update...  After finding the brackets, the rest of the install was fairly painless.  I do however have challenges for any hood installation that I won't get into. the unit is quiet on it's lowest fan setting, and certainly quieter than my previous hood at the higher fan settings.  Did not come with a user manual, does come with install instructions and templates.<br /><br />1st update...  Eureka Brackets found!  After some disassembly of the interior covers, located between the fans.<br /><br />Video shows EZ 1 brackets included,  mine didn't come with then.  I may update my rating after I figure out how to install it without brackets or find a source for the brackets.",5
324342,42,"There are at least two types of filters available for my LG refridgerator.  Both do what they are supposed to do, and both are fairly expensive, I think.  The ones I use are the most expensive version.  Why?  Because I have well water, which is really very good, but since it is not chlorinated and is subject to possible contamination from incecticides, fertilizers, etc., I think it's worth the cost to have a ""do everything"" filter.  This model (LT600P/5231JAA2006B) will remove almost anything.  The less expensive model does little to remove most chemical contaminants or small particles like cysts.  Probably not a big problem, but why not spend a bit more and be sure?  All that said, I also do not change filters every 6 months, more like once a year, since the total volume we use dosen't require more frequent changes.  Good product, and certainly more afforable from Amazon.",5
117627,42,"Well-made, perfect fit and I was pleased to see that these are made by Broan.",5
25777,42,"I've seen several reviews stating people have had problems with the seal on this filter, but I've had no such problems. Works very well!",4
338177,42,"I drink a lot of coffee.  OK…an InSANE amount of coffee.  It was costing me a fortune in K-cups, so I decided to give this scoop/funnel a try.  I’m glad I did.  Using this with a reusable K-Cup and paper filters, I shouldn’t have to buy K-Cups again.  It scoops a bit too much for the paper filters I bought, but scooping the right amount is a matter of practice ‘till perfect.",5
302654,42,"I read several of the reviews for this product, and in spite of some that indicated trouble, ordered. Here's my take on how you can improve your success rate with it. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Maybe they weren't included with the product reflected in some of the reviews, but they're in there now. They tell you twice not to fill the SlickDrip more than halfway and not to touch it, because...wait for it...it may collapse and you may make a mess and get burned. I didn't have any trouble with it. I'm willing to concede it may relax after while and if it does, I'll come back to eat crow.<br /><br />Some reviewers indicate it drains too fast, producing weak coffee. Two factors may affect that, neither of which is in the instructions. However, the vendor sent an e-mail with detailed instructions on how to make the best coffee. Really nothing in there for you if you know how to make coffee. You need the correct grind, which is described as medium, &#34;slightly larger than coarse sand.&#34; the correct grind is essential to the flow rate. The second factor is the filter. I haven't studied the porosity of filters, always using the same one. However, it can vary, and that will affect retention time. You may want to experiment. The more important consideration is to follow the instructions of the filter manufacturer. Did you ever read the box? Did you fold the filter on the crimped seams? This provides a strengthened rib along one edge that contacts the filter, and along the bottom seam. The weight of the water compresses it against the seam. Inasmuch as the water always has to flow through the doubled seam edge on the bottom, the flow rate is slowed.<br /><br />I made great coffee with the SlickDrip. It's as good as anything from a Keurig, more similar to the results of the Chemex pour-over I own, and I'm a coffee snob. I'm very satisfied with it. I may buy another!",5

128281,42,"Really worked better than I thought. I had the original one that was from the manufacturer and was pissed at what they charged me for one yes (1). When I called the office of the mfg, they indicated to me that it was only supposed to work for just a few months. BS. Anyway I got mine and it worked terrific, the only issue is that the top flips open as opposed to the mfg brand that twists on. What I did was to get a sharpie and place an arrow at the tip where you open the pod. Otherwise excellent for the dinero.",4

It was about a 10 minute job to replace these engagement dawgs which returned full function to the agitator. Nice inexpensive fix to the old machine rather than forking over a lot of dough for a replacement washer.",5

56099,42,"Didn't purchase from Amazon but posting review.  Ideally, this sounds perfect and is supposed to only increase you're electric about $10-$20 per month depending on how much laundry you do. It's just me so one load of laundry per week, except sheet week, so what can be wrong? This machine never dries!!!! First one I got took 12 hours to dry my clothes and they came out smelling burnt. I learned that apparently the first one was defective. The new one has now taken 6hours to dry. I understand it will take longer than regular machines but 6 hours is ridiculous. And I'm talking a regular one person load of small clothes and maybe a small towel!  Six hours!!!!!!  So I go to take the clothes out right away bc I notice they never smell clean and sure enough, they smell like dirty dish water, rather than the degergent and fabric softener I used. Oh, they are also a complete wrinkled mess, which I've never had an issue with on regular w/d units. Sorry, I hate ironing which is why I love things that can go in the dryer bc they don't come out wrinkled. I HATE THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE AND IT IS BEING RETURNED ASAP.  Let's not talk about how much my electric bill jumped bc the machine was running for 12 hours last time. WTF?  Great idea, but clearly something isn't right in the design.",1
44545,42,Product was returned. The stub end was too small and would not stay in the grate aperture.,1
400359,42,The water filled valve on my washing machine was broke I ordered this part to replace it I replaced it and it works perfectly therefore I love it.,5
31902,42,This product requires the build up of frost to be removed every few days.,1
231253,42,One in every 10 blows out the bottom and it does not hold enough to make the coffee as strong as I want it to be. I think all of this would be fixed if the paper cups extended down to the bottom of the filter so it had support and could hold more. The way it is now you have to use two so it does not blow out and weak coffee.,2

542420,42,"The hose clip was much smaller than expected but with some muscle we were able to fit the drain hose to our refurbished 21 year-old Maytag washer inside the clip. You can see in the pictures this hose fits smaller diameter hoses well, our hose is larger at the end and required some elbow grease to fit the clip around it. So far the clip pinches the straight edge of out utility sink tightly and has not slipped of when water is draining out of the hose. Even at $15 the clip is overpriced, but is serves a critical purpose if you need to control a hose that drains water into a sink as pictured.<br /><br />Updated 3/1/2021 The clamp broke after three weeks of use and is now useless, waste of money avoid. See picture.",1

93740,42,At first we thought we had really found a treasure. This was a fraction of the price of an original equipment filter. I installed it and it seemed to work fine. Then about 3 weeks later our water started having a strong metallic taste. The water from the tap had a better flavor. Today I replaced this filter with a Samsung brand and now no more metal taste in the water. Save your money and buy the original equipment filter.,1

290402,42,"I purchased this during the lockdowns to be able to wash minimal items in my home, as I live in a NYC apartment. I have had it for a year now, and while it does help on those days you don't want to go to the laundromat, you use so much water and multiple rinse loads to remove even the tiniest about of soap from the machine.  I'm talking I will have to rinse 5 shirts like 7 times and still use my shower head to rinse out suds. This is even when I do spin dry cycles in between to remove water.  It could be possible that my unit isn't working correctly, but I have contacted the seller and not yet heard back.  I will be calling support because I reached out a month ago and it shouldn't be having this issue a year in. I also noticed that sometimes the floor is a little wet underneath my machine. I wash in my bathroom so I just mop it after, but in other areas, it wouldn't be okay.  I personally wouldn't buy again due to these reasons, and the fact that I'm not impressed with the customer service.",3

542344,42,This ice maker is excellent for the price. It does produce at least 40 pounds of ice if not more. The only thing is you need to make sure you have a storage container in your freezer to store ice. The storage in the ice maker is small. I just put a plastic bowl in the freezer and I never run out of ice. I highly recommend it.,5
614216,42,Love it .Used it for our Fathers Day party and it was very convenient. Also stockpiled 20 pounds of ice from the machine the day before for coolers. I know people who take this camping with a tent where water and electric are at the site if yo have a good cooler its as good as a fridge.,5
659375,42,"I washed 2oz of quality with this machine and it just kept giving. I did 10 runs total, then froze the flowers to use later when I have more ice.

656713,42,"I am rating it two stars because you can kind of &#34;make it work&#34; if you are willing to tape things to the cup. However after doing so it only worked less than half of the time and when it did it was recognized as a kcup, not a kmug or kcarafe.<br />It seems like it depends on when your machine was built in if this thing will work for you.

167705,42,Self destructed after 2 years of very light useage. Did poor job of cleaning clothes in the meantime.

111646,42,"Good water filter for my side by side Kenmore Fridge. Product claims to last 6 months, I think it can probably last a little longer than that even. You do need to flush a gallon or two of water through when you first install it so that some of the grayish water / particles get dumped instead of drank. You also need to cycle a bunch of air through the system before it flows entirely properly. At this price (under 20 dollars) it's quite a bit cheaper than most of the other filters on the market so it's hard to beat that price.<br /><br />If your city water sucks, I definitely recommend this.",5

My wife says it's the best black coffee she's ever had. Unlike with french press or a melitta filter, no cream or other additive was needed to take out any sort of bitterness.

If GE had stamped or etched the stainless steel, it would be easy to fill in with some model paint.  I notice that only the high end cook-tops have etched lettering so maybe I'm expecting too much - but I did buy the &#34;Profile&#34;.

The first filter out of the 3-pack leaked everywhere, making us think that we’d ordered the wrong size filter. The second worked well.

This is the XWF filter. We got an error message no matter how we installed it.<br /><br />There is a chip missing in the XWF filters. So shame on GE for adding this nonsense.

561143,42,Very handy to keep one at home. One day our fridge starting leaking water in the vegetable bins.

It is an excellent appliance for the best price that I could find, delivered on time to my front door.  Easy to set up and install.

280411,42,"I have a new LG LFXC24726D that I purchased in 2019. When it came time to change the filter, I purchased these filters. Unfortunately, they leaked. I had LG come out and they replaced the holder on the refrigerator, but they still leaked. I purchased the actual LG replacement filter, it leaked. I suspected the O-rings on the filters were not thick enough to seal (LG has since changed their filter design and they now screw in). I went to Lowes and purchased Danko #9 O-rings to replace the larger ring (probably the more important one) and #6 O-rings for the smaller ring. As you can see from the picture, the #9 ring is significantly thicker than the ring that came on the filter. No leak. To change the O-rings, I recommend using a pin/needle to get under the O-ring as it's difficult to get off. The velocity of flow out of the refrigerator is much slower with the new O-ring, I suspect the previous rings were not forcing water through the filter and likely the filtration was poor. Water tastes very good from this filter and it lasted about 6 months. Since it is so much cheaper than the LG OEM filters, I am happy. Also, the air filters work fine.",4

614658,42,"I did not buy a refrigerator filter as you stated in your email to me. I emailed your company to get clarification on your product's use  and the email was returned saying it was not a valid email! Anyhow, there are differing opinions about where the 'water reservoir' is that needs to be emptied. Keurig calls the internal  reservoir the water reservoir while my friends state it is where we add water to make a cup of coffee.It is an involved process to empty the internal reservoir so I added it to the external one. A good hint would have been to do what I did- I added a drop of food coloring to the water so I knew when I had used all the descaled water up. To tell you the truth, i didn't see much of a difference in the water flow after using it. Maybe I should do it twice? I did try to descale it with vinegar a few months ago but again, saw little improvement. Maybe it is my keurig...",3

517889,42,"I bought this dishwasher to replace a 16 year old dishwasher made by another manufacturer that was no longer working properly and could not be fixed. After extensive research and going to the GE website to compare quality, I bought this one because of what they said it would do. What a joke. It won't clean properly, you have to pre-wash everything in order for it to clean. It won't dry the dishes properly and although it is energy efficient, you can't load as much into it so it defeats the purpose. My old worn out dishwasher did a better job. I contacted GE and got no satisfaction and no help. FINALLY got GE to send a repairman out. The repairman told me there was nothing wrong with the machine. His solution was that the dishwashing detergent I was using was the problem - funny thing, the detergent I was using was the same as the sample pack they included with the dishwasher. I had made it a point to buy exactly the same thing and was using what they recommended. If there is nothing wrong with the machine and it doesn't work, then where does that leave you? I've been buying appliances for 41 years and have never had reason to complain until now. I will never buy another GE product regardless of what they profess it will do.",1

Who wants to take a chance with their family's lives? Within in a year, I reported that it had a warped lint shield less than a year after buying it. Up to a gallon of lint builds up in the interior of the machine. I measured it and showed it to repair tech, and paid warranty says it's not a mechanical failure so it's not eligible for repair. Then, the gas leak. Just wasted $800 on GE and more hours of my life than I care to admit. Bought an inexpensive dryer, and the leaking unit is now in the garage.

I only needed an inch, so I had about 8 inches of the periscope on either side of the vents which abstracted the space where the washer was going.

503538,42,"I'll be honest, I was very sceptical about a plastic washing machine. But this thing is just awesome! I have had it for 3 months now. I am a single male, and I use it about 2-3 times per week. I have had ZERO problems with it. I pulled it out of the box, put it in the shower surround, filled it with water and washed. There is NO assembly to do. And it is of quite good quality all around. It's not a bunch of cheap plastic that will fall apart in a year. This thing is so cool!<br /><br />You can place this ANYWHERE there is a drain nearby. I live in a small studio apartment. I dont have a typical tub/shower. Just a shower surround. So I just place it in the shower, drop the drain hose onto the floor, fill it with water and wash. Don't think it doesn't wash as well as a full size. It does! It is surprisingly quiet in both wash and spin cycles. Almost silent. So if you live in a multi-unit apartment complex, you dont need to worry about pissing off your neighbors.<br /><br />It's a money saver too! Because in the wash cycle, the motor spins the tub in one direction for a few seconds then stops. It pauses for a few seconds, then spins in the opposite direction for a few seconds. So it use very little energy, whereas a full size washer uses a much bigger motor and it runs continuously for the entire wash cycle. There are 2 seperate motors in the unit. And the motors seem to be of good quality, and quite strong. I'm not worried about them failing after a year or so.<br />Another way it saves money is bc there is no heating element to dry clothes. BIG money saver right there! Instead, it has a seperate compartment which houses a stainless steel basket. The other motor spins the wet clothes so fast that it actually does a fantastic job of almost completely drying the clothes. It spins on a 0-5 minute automatic timer. More than enogh to do the job. (Note: full synthetic items come out  almost completely dry. Only slightly damp to the touch. Cotton jeans and towels and the like, come out damp, and require some dry time. Depending on the climate where you live. If you live in a humid area, it may take a half day to dry the heavier cotton items)<br />Another way it saves money is that you really only add NO MORE than a tablespoon of laundry detergent. Seriously, that is PLENTY.<br /><br />This 9.9 lb machine i bought, can do a pair of jeans and a few pairs of underware and socks in one load. Or one full size thick cotton bath towel and a few smaller items per load. I can easily fit full size bed sheets in it, but only top sheet, then bottem sheet in another load. But it handles it just fine. I'm pretty sure the 9.9 lb would handle a queen size. A full size comforter....No way, forget about it. Take that to the laundromat.  (I think that one of the 13  lb machines will handle a comfortor though.) It will handle about 5-7 cotton t-shirts per load.<br /><br />There is definetly more ""hands on"" work with one of these machines as compared to a full size automatic. Bc you do a wash cycle, (about 10-12 minutes) then you have to turn a knob to the ""drain"" setting, let it drain (takes about 20 seconds), then refill with water, turn knob to wash cycle, (which is really the rinse cycle. I do about 6 minute rinse), then come back and turn knob to drain. Then, move clothes over to the other compartment on the right, set timer to 5 minutes to spin clothes dry. As you are spinning, you can be filling up wash tub for next load. (YES, you can be washing and spinning at the same time bc compartments, settings, timers and motors are seperate systems). I know all that sounds like alot of work, but it really isn't. It's so quick and simple that it's almost fun! I bought some cheap extendable clothes hanging bars, that I put between the hallway walls to hang clothes on. When I'm done washing, I just pick up the unit and place it in the back hallway. The thing is super lightweight, that a 90 yo grandma can easily move it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Cheap...$80.33 shipped to the house<br />-Good quality<br />-Very light weight<br />-Can be used in any dwelling where there is no waher/dryer hookups (perfect for apartments, studios, businesses, rv's/camp trailers etc)<br />-Uses almost no electricity. So it can be easily used with very small solar systems like you'd have in rv's etc<br />-uses very little detergent, no more than 1 tblsp per load<br />- Easily portable. So if you move, and the new place doesn't have W/D hookups....no problem<br />- Cleans every bit as good  as a full size unit<br />- Very quiet operation in both wash and spin. Great for multi-unit apartment complexes.<br />- Excellent option if your full size breaks down and you cant afford to replace it right away<br />- Much smaller loads save water. Although you do more loads, I still feel like it would use less than a full size would use.<br /> - Very user friendly.<br />- Has a lint trap inside washer unit, that easily slides out/in for cleaning. And yes, it actually works surprisingly well. Traps quit a bit of lint.<br />- Solidly made<br />- Perfect for 1-2 people household<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Smaller loads so its more hands on. Bigger size machines wouldn't have this con.<br /><br />If you buy it and it turns out to be too small, exchange it, or give it to someone who needs it. Or donate it to a small business like an animal shelter, hair salon, food bank, charity organization etc.<br /><br />Hope this helped!",5
343523,42,This thing was super easy to install and was so much better than those crappy flexi ducts. The 90° bends also made it so my dryer scooted much closer to the wall than usual.<br />The only minor problem was that a plastic piece opened up a little bit during install and I couldn't get it snapped back together. A quick duct tape job fixed it easily and I'm still really happy with it.<br /><br />I will definitely buy this type of product again in the future.,5

574685,42,"What Amazon's product page says:<br /><br />【Large-capacity space】This is a two-layer egg box, one layer can store 20 eggs, and a total of 40 eggs can be stored. The drawer design is dust-proof and moisture-proof, so that each egg can be kept intact and fresh. Product Dimensions: 10.8 x 8.6 x 5.9 Inch.<br /><br />【High-quality material】This egg carton is made of high-quality food-grade plastic, PBA-free, thick and durable, and the transparent material allows you to clearly see the storage of the eggs.<br /><br />【Space saving】The egg carton is compact and stackable, which can save a lot of space in the refrigerator, making the refrigerator look neat and orderly, and the groove design prevents it from being crushed or smashed.<br /><br />【Wide range of use】Egg carton is suitable for refrigerator, freezer, kitchen, dining table, storage room, camping and picnic. It can be easily put in the refrigerator and other places for easy portability.<br /><br />【After-sales service 】Our products are well tested, inspected and packaged before shipment. If you have any questions or suggestions about these egg tray, please feel free to contact us. Our service team will provide you with a 100% satisfactory answer within 24 hours.<br /><br />What I say:<br /><br />First off, my pet peeve: Why do all egg storage bins have such an odd number of eggs they hold? This one holds 40. If you purchase 3 dozen eggs, that is 36. So why 40? I just do not get it.<br /><br />But that is a minor thing, really.<br /><br />This 2-drawer bin is sturdier than most others that I have had in the past. It is well designed and the eggs within (unless they are small eggs) fit nicely so there is no rocking/rolling around in the bin to possibly break them - causing a MESS. Each egg is cradled in a dip. (So why would anyone purchase a bin where the eggs roll and break? It is just beyond my understanding.)<br /><br />Easy to clean; however, I have filled mine up 3X now and it is still spotless. I did wash it once though, in a dish washing machine. I did not notice anything in the package saying that it was hand wash only and did not want to post that it was machine washable without testing it first. (If it does not hold up to multiple washing, I will come back and edit this post.)<br /><br />It top portion is clear so you can easily see how many eggs you have left.<br /><br />As usual, I will come back and edit this review if the product does not last long, is defective, or anything else.",4

I soaked up as much as I could and tried taking the product off, but the tubes like they are designed would not come off (like they are supposed to). .

136885,42,"[[VIDEOID:4fd222938153f33c6f93079d83e0720d]] I'm so glad I bought this washer! I gave this product 5 stars because it really does the job. Clothes come out clean and nearly dry.  I use less detergent. I don't have to drag my stuff 4-5 blocks. I don't have to worry about having enough money to do the wash (just enough to buy the washer n stuff, lol).<br /><br />I'm grateful for the reviews and videos posted because they give great advise! CHECK THEM OUT; all of them. This product comes with some kind of instructions but no practical directions.  The videos are filled with different types of practical advise. Some of the videos seem to be in not-so-small apartments that have washer hookups or standing drainage areas, lol. My apartment is small--750 sq ft--and has none of that.  Don't be discouraged. This product is described as good for small apartments; and, it is. The dimensions are perfect. It's light enough to move back and forth and fit into small spaces. People who have difficulties lifting more than 20 lbs might have an issue if they need to lift it or carry multiple buckets of water.  Not to worry, brainstorm.<br /><br />Items you may need to purchase in addition to your washer: extension cord, inlet water hose, drainage hose, sturdy table, bucket or trash bin. Wait to receive your washer before purchasing any extra items.<br /><br />* The washer is small and low; makes some but not a lot of noise. Do you have a sturdy table to put it on whether or not you'll be putting it in the bathtub? Do you have any ideas about where you want to put and use it?<br />* DO NOT leave your operating washer unattended! This machine will move--especially at the beginning and ending of your cycles; especially if loads are unbalanced!  Is your table sturdy enough to deal with movement?  Will your moving machine end up unplugging itself, moving other items, or falling off the table? How much time do you have to hold your machine in place while it does its job? Remain aware of what is going on with your machine.<br />* The electrical cord is short. Do you have an extension cord?<br />* The inlet hose doesn't fit all faucets, so have a plan. You can use a detachable shower head, kitchen faucet hose, or a bucket of water to fill your wash bin. You can purchase an appropriately-fitting hose; however, would you know what that is??  Why make yourself crazy?<br />If you have a detachable shower head, does putting the washer in the bathtub mean your electrical cord will cross over your faucet, shower head, or sit in the tub during draining cycle? Bad idea, unless you unhook the electrical cord each time and put it out of harms way  OR  are able to position washer and cord properly so water and cord don't overlap  AND  put the washer on a table so the electrical cord doesn't sit in your bathtub. Will you remember to do this EVERY TIME or at all?  If you are anything like me, that would be a NO. Don't risk damaging your machine before you finish your first load!  Know yourself and do what is best for you considering all of your circumstances.<br />* The wash cycle has 5 timer settings which can be set to ""soft"" or ""standard"" agitation levels. It's up to you how long a wash cycle to run. Lifting the lid does not stop the wash cycle but does let you see whether the appropriate amount of detergent was used. You can add more, if needed. Standard agitation level is strong and works well. It might surprise you. Once wash cycle starts, you should NOT try to force or shorten the amount of time set. You will break your machine!  Let it run; it will finish soon. Always start your timer at the least amount of time needed to wash whatever. You can always run it again after the cycle ends.  You may be able to add time to your wash.  I did this absentmindedly. Thank God, I didn't damage my machine. I think adding time to the washer cycle might be ok but I don't do that anymore. I just wash everything at 15 mins, lol.<br />* The drainage hose is too short, so have a plan:  Will you be using the washer in the bathtub? Can the hose reach the sink while the washer is on the floor? If it does not, do you have a bucket or trash bin into which the dirty water can drain? Will you need to put the washer on a table?<br />I LOVE that the ""drain"" cycle (not the wash cycle) can be stopped at any time, so you can dump the water then return to draining. ** Don't forget to turn the knob each time to ""standard"" wash to stop the draining or you'll end up with water all over your floor--like me, lol.<br />* A wonderful tip I saw on one of the videos was about rinsing. After the draining cycle, turn knob to ""standard"" wash, refill the wash bin, run another wash cycle for maybe less time, then drain again. This is especially helpful if you put too much detergent and still have suds in your wash bin. Yup, it happens within the first few wash cycles as you learn how much detergent to use for the various types of materials being washed. Washing underwear usually requires less detergent than fuzzy pajamas or oversized towels.<br />Example #1:  10 underwear, one t-shirt, and a pair of shorts in a 15-min wash load took half of the wash bin requiring maybe a tablespoon of detergent.  After washing then draining, refilled wash bin halfway, ran wash cycle for 9 mins then drained again. I divided the wash load in half; this load required 2 separate spin cycles of 5 mins each. Underwear were nearly dry; t-shirt and shorts, almost dry. Time lapse: 34 mins plus machine set up.<br />Example #2:  2 oversized towels in a wash load took a little more than half the wash bin and required more detergent.  Washed then drained, refilled wash bin a little more than halfway, ran wash cycle for 15 mins then drained again. Spun each towel separately requiring 2 separate spin cycles of 5 mins each. Towels were damp, no water dripping at all! Time lapse: 40 mins plus machine set up.<br />* The machine gets hot. So, you may want to fill your wash bin halfway to keep the motor or belt from burning out. This machine is not made with steel or other heavy metals--which is why it's so light. Therefore, overusing it or putting in very hot water may damage it.  Be kind to yourself. Be kind to your machine. You have a washer in your place now. You can do another load later. Don't forget, you are standing there holding and / or watching your machine for however long. Don't waste your money or push the boundaries of your sanity by breaking your washer.<br />* The spin cycle is fabulous!  Items come out very nearly dry, almost dry, or damp needing to be hung for a little while. Don't forget to put your machine in ""drain"" cycle to release the water from the spin cycle. The spin cycle also stops when you lift the lid which is helpful when balancing uneven loads.  There are 2 lids, the outer and inner lid. Be careful. When closing the lids, close the inner lid first so that it doesn't snap off.  Don't force it. When spin cycle starts up again, the machine will shake like crazy. Hold your machine!<br />* Between washes and draining, TILT your machine toward the drainage hose side and be ready with your bucket. It appears some water remains in the barrel within the machine. Drain it.  I found out the hard way when I was moving my washer and found mysterious puddles of water on the floor.  It happened a couple of times before I realized what was going on. I imagine that's why some customers complained of molding. If you don't drain it, the mold will come, lol. Wipe the inside of the lids and the wash and spin bins after use.<br />My experience:  I was frustrated initially because needed a few things I didn't have: a table I could carry and use in either the kitchen or bathtub; a bucket or trash bin that wasn't too big so the water wouldn't be too heavy to lift every time I washed and drained; a mat to mute machine movement and sound so downstairs neighbor won't get frustrated; and drainage hose, inlet hose--neither fit my faucets. So, I bought those things. I wasted money on the hose but everything else was great; I got it all on Amazon.  I have a faucet hose in the kitchen sink. I put the washer on a table in the kitchen using the faucet hose to fill the wash bin. I use my trash bin, which doubles as a bucket, to drain the dirty water I dump into the sink. Machine setup and breakdown time is about 7-10 mins. Perfect! I highly recommend the SUPER DEAL Compact Mini Twin Tub Washing Machine with Spinner.",5

It's 2 handles make it really convenient to move too.<br />This is a nicely made and large Noodle board, and let me tell you, I make a lot of things with dough and it is ideal for setting up to roll it out.  I engage it this way every Friday Night for Homemade Pizza! It's size and wooden surface made it perfect for this!<br /><br /> I can think of so many ways to use this past the obvious ones. It can be used as a big gathering charcuterie board, or a portable table top. etc. It is great for projects, and I like working jigsaw puzzles on it and then sliding it under the bed out of the way until I can get back to it.  It's uses are limitless!<br /><br />I am so glad to have this as an addition to my kitchen and home. Maybe one day I'll even make Noodles!",5

256681,42,"Directions are lacking a little but I usually do not need them. The unit works awesome and has great suction. The noise level is very reasonable. In California, code requires solid metal ducting. The plastic that comes with it is not legal. For about $20, I purchased the correct venting and it was easy to attach. It was definitely helpful that we're remodeling and the ceiling was open. This DEFINITELY needs two people to install. There were a couple of minor bends in the inner metal sheathing, but not noticeable. For the price, this is a very nice looking island hood - a nice upgrade in the house!",5

5180,42,So far we spent full price money for a washer and dryer that are not working correctly. I do have to say that GE has sent out a service person and he said that my shocks to the washer are not good-weird because it's brand new. We have only used the washer three times and then called for repair. As long as they fix it and it works I will be super happy:),2
1825,42,"The filter is extremely effective - we are using it in a costal area where the tap water tends to have a metallic taste.  The filter effectively removes that flavoring, leaving nuetral flavored water.  It is, however, a definite challenge removing the old filter, even once the light cover and shelf are removed, it is still a pain to remove.  However, once the fridge decides to reelease the old filter, the new is easily installed, the locked and unlocked indicators make aligning the filter a snap, and the successful seating has a tangible physical feel as well as a sound.",4

620196,42,"Our laundry dryer vent was an old aluminum flap that just wouldn't shut and cold air was the norm in our laundry room.  We read all the reviews on this product and decided that most of the complaints were due to folks not wanting to do a little install work.  We purchased our Heartland dryer vent, painted it, installed it (with a little tweak) and we couldn't be more surprised at how the laundry room is now warmer, an additional bonus is that it's quieter - no more outside noise.<br />For us, we simply pulled off the old flap, did some insulating around the existing area since the stucco hole was a little wider than the vent tube, and our 55 year old house has no insulation in the walls.  We also had slightly uneven stucco so to attempt to make the new vent as secure as it could be, we took rubber window insulation and placed that around the base of the unit where it connects to the house, screwed it in place, and used paintable caulking to further seal the connection. In total, the install project might have taken 45 minutes.  Well worth the level of comfort we now enjoy.<br />For those who are not savy with a screwdriver, you might want to stear clear.  But for those who have a bit of comon sense, this will certainly improve the level of comfort in your laundry room.",5

602943,42,"Absolutely love it! So happy I decided to get it!  You have to Remember that this isn't a full size dryer, you can't expect to load it like one.  I also have the panda washer with the spinner. I'll wash all my clothes, put them on the drying rack and when the load is out of the dryer I put in a new load. I run everything on the hot cycle.  I get caught up with netflix so I'm not an expert on saying how long everything takes to dry. I have it on my bedroom dresser. I put a knee high on the top of the exhaust.. &#34;just in case&#34; and it hasn't caught any spare lint. You do have to clean the lint trap a lot though. I'm not even sure if I have it done right lol the images in the paper book are horribly confusing.<br />Update: I've had it almost a year. I still love it. But every now and then, the timer moves in the opposite direction. Which is fine unless I can't have something in the heat cycle. Anyone else have that problem?",5

206176,42,"This is a beautiful, sleek, professional looking upgrade to our 25+ year old vent hood. I bought it because it offered a pronged cord option just like my old one. Since I did not want to completely renovate and add venting holes in the wall, this was perfect for me. However the cord is only 3 feet long and does not reach any outlet including the one readily available behind the stove. My old cord was 5 feet long and much thinner and was easily hidden under the cabinetry. I will have to buy and extension cord to make this usable and the thick black cord will dangle from the middle of the hood against the wall which might drive me crazy. Other than that, the function is superb.",4

208925,42,"I purchased one of these washing machines 3 years ago to use in my motorhome which I live in full time. It has performed flawlessly in that time. There are times when I have parked my motorhome at locations where a laundry facility was not available and it has saved me the trouble of running to the nearest laundry mat to wash my clothes.<br /><br />The washer holds a generous amount of clothes, but I have learned to not overload it. If there are too many clothes in it I can hear the belt slipping as the machine is in wash cycle. As with most washing machines, loading clothes in a balanced manner is important, but not difficult to accomplish and this Haier washer is somewhat forgiving if the load is a little out of balance.<br /><br />I have been happy with the ability of this machine to get my clothes clean, even without having an agitator. I see no difference in the wash quality when using this machine and when the dirty water empties into the sink I can tell that there is plenty of dirt being removed from my clothes.<br /><br />The size is also just right for my motorhome. Overall, I am very impressed with this machine which I have been using weekly for the past 3 years.",5

635457,42,"I bought this because the individual cups are too expensive. However it does not work great.  If you load too much coffee in it, the water flow is blocked and you only get a 1/2 cup of coffee that is dark but with little substance.  If you load too little coffee in it, you get medium dark water without flavor.  So, not really good for extracting flavor from grounds.<br /><br />It basically turns your Keurig into a 'drip' coffee maker because unlike the cups, there is too much filter area for water to flow through.  At this point, I am going back to a drip machine as the coffee from this cup is too weak and the cups are too expensive.",3

The bottom one doesn't give at all under the weight of the full one on top. Each can hold 21 or a couple more eggs. So, you can store 42 at least between both. The eggs will automatically roll out, but not fast or unexpectedly. The cover on the front is well suited to helping with that. I also have stored lemons and limes in mine. There is no assembly required. You may think this is an eggstravant purchase if you still use store cartons, but I think I have eggsplained the eggstrodinary need for these egg containers.

255550,42,"Our local water municipality recently changed the concentration of the chlorine in our water (short term I hope) which led to our water tasting like it was taken from a swimming pool. When the water was tasting fine we just had a bypass plug installed in our GE refrigerator as we didn't see the need for a filter if the water was fine. I debated back and forth between the full priced &#34;GE&#34; filter and the lower priced filter here. For half the price, I decided to give it a try and it has been excellent. We've been using it for several weeks and our ice and water taste great again (no more swimming pool smell!).

I can see where the other reviewers are putting tap over the wave function to turn it on and adjust the speed.  I am not sure if mine is working and when....I think it needs to be up higher for it to work.  It's lower than most installations due to the cabinet height.  But, it is LOW sound.  Does not rattle. High quality.  Great product.",5

154508,42,"I researched portable washers for days. I live in a small 3bd town house I have 4 children and the on-site laundry is nasty and expensive. I received this washer and did my first load immediately. I can tell the difference right away in how clean my clothes are! It's not so loud that you can hear it outside, however I can hear it downstairs which isn't a big deal and isn't so loud that it's concerning. I used my shower head to fill the washer up, drained spinned and then did rinse cycle! My clothes are so much dryer now compared to the brand new washers in the on site laundry. I mostly hang dry my clothes regardless of what they are being washed in anyways so me having to hang dry is not a big deal. The next load I am going to rinse on the rinse side and see how that goes. I will eventually build a little stand for it to go on and create a drain bucket for ease! I plan on doing a load every other day or so as needed and if this thing can with stand my family for 6 months then it has saved me tons of money and time and cleanliness! I typically spend over 100$ a month for my family of 6 to do laundry! Buy it you'll be happy 😊",5

It made ice extremely fast and we put a bag in the freezer to keep a stockpile since the little basket doesn't hold a lot and I wanted to use all the water in the reservoir.<br /><br />It's super easy to use and I set the time to keep going until the water was gone. I fell asleep early and woke up the next morning and the ice was just fine being stored in the basket.<br /><br />While this won't be our primary ice maker, when i want to make cocktails or have people over, I fully intend to bring this out because it churns out great ice very fast.

188607,42,"Not only do you save money every time you use it, you also get to enjoy whatever favorite coffee of yours you put in it. I have not experienced any of the problems others have complained about such as water leaking around it or coffee grounds in your cup. I think part of the reason for this happening with others is that they do not fill the little mesh holder all the way up with coffee. It looks as if I will get about 40- 50 cups of coffee per pound of grounds used, so at $9 per pound ( Dunkin' Donuts ) the cost will break down to under 20 cents per cup of your favorite brew. I do not use it exclusively, but in addition to the K-cups. It takes only minutes to clean up and you are ready for the next use.
