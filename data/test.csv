175693,42,"the part was new, fast shipping, fixed the issue with my refrigerator.",5,5
12574,42,not the right one for my refrigerator,5,5
44665,42,exact the same as the old one.,5,5
549615,42,good instructions. can't beat the price.,5,5
285443,42,easy to use perfect amount. doesn't make a mess. great for unsteady hands,5,5
166196,42,product was exactly what i ordered and the correct one.,5,5
410938,42,"we had so much noise that the neighbor's could hear it. it sounded like a jack hammer called support and found out i should unplug and wait 4 to 6 hours and plug back in. we did this and unbelievable, it is quiet. thanks for the fix w o w (about a month later). spoke to soon! about a week after it started again and nothing works. sent request to replace it or get me something else. this machine is not good. do not buy one.",5,1
45700,42,"this is the recommended stacking kit for whirlpool washer & dryer front loaders (duet) that can be stacked. be sure you have access to both sides of the machine and position with 2 adults. fits duet, maytag epic z, perf series 2000 amana tandem 7300, and kenmore. comes with 2 brackets & screws. what else id there to say. it does what it is supposed to do.",5,5
242400,42,"just installed today, installation was easy,",5,5
143674,42,"bought these two filters for replacement in our ge profile fridge in oct 2017. first one worked fine, but the second one didn't work. it was like it was clogged. hardly any water was coming out. beware- after having it for months, you can't click on replace or return button from amazon",1,1
321550,42,"warped greatly on the first use. part of successful broiling requires that the food lays flat and is the same distance from the heat. that is not possible with this cheap broiling pan. i will probably never use it again. makes me wonder how other reviewers here raved about it's quality and mentioned that it did not warp. how much did it warp? two of the corners of the rack were warped upwards at least 1"" from the pan. that's ridiculous. update: i have used this pan several times again since the first time and for reasons that i can not explain, the pan is no longer warping during use. based on this, i would now recommend this broiler pan.",5,1
691236,42,it worked well and did what it was supposed to do and was also cheaper than a name brand replacement,5,5
651440,42,"i suspect shops don’t want to stock these filters, when they enjoy serious reorders & mark-up on k-cup compatible coffee. and no, i don’t buy into the “french press” snob argument. if you want a decent *pot* of coffee, the larger melitta filter cones are hard to beat. ymmv.",5,5
471936,42,works ok and fits well. but delivery was very slow ordered on dec. 2 and it arrived on jan. 14 in a small nondescript bag from china. it took so long to arrive that i forgot i ordered it.,5,5
493419,42,"easy to install, fast delivery! thank you!",5,5
243777,42,"unfortunately, i'm not a plumber, so the hose sits in its shipping case awaiting the challenge of installation without finding an unexpected leak!",5,5
520978,42,our ice maker is crap and this little machine has been wonderful. the first day it made 8 pounds of ice! i'll have plenty of ice when the family comes in for the holidays.,5,5
449983,42,"easy install, working wonderful. delivered quickly.",5,5
499253,42,"good price, but they do not stay attached to the whirlpool dryer door very well. i will probably have to use some type of gorilla glue to keep them in place. unfortunately, oem part costs nearly $40, and is probably not much better.",5,5
89454,42,so far the water flitering working good.,5,5
693660,42,great for the price! don’t need to be 100% accurate for what i’m using them for. they work as they’re supposed to.,5,5
274268,42,these filters are a perfect fit for my keurig machine. they work well and filter the water before it goes into the heater.,5,5
595750,42,"amazing! making ice so fast, and self cleaning works perfectly. the shape of the ice are cute. there are two types of ices, large and small. it is really nice!",5,5
19050,42,great replacement for the one i had before!,5,5
424609,42,fit exactly as expected. this doesn't come with shelf clips though so you might need to buy some. there are different sizes for god knows what reason though so make sure you get the right size.,5,5
355597,42,"even after 6 months, i can tastea difference in my filtered water. a new filter always restored the fresh flavor i expect, and the water pressure of my refrigerator significantly improves. i keep buying the original because of its predictable performance.",5,5
143567,42,works great. the water flows again. it was slow but it happens so gradually you don’t realize the water flow is half what it was. can’t beat the price.,5,5
7702,42,"we got this part april 28, 2023 and it is no longer working. very disappointing to say the least.",5,5
295856,42,"good price, fast delivery and quality product",5,5
268810,42,"i bought these filters because they are what came with our fridge. i expected them to be an expensive item but were not and each one lasts about 6 months for us. what more can be said? they install easily, last a very long time and they are cheap.",5,5
586446,42,es simple vale la pena arreglar la cegadora uno mismo y las partes son baratas,5,5
428134,42,"made the perfect cup of coffee in my keurig k express. fits great, works well.",5,5
8759,42,love it. one of the best things i ever bought! amazing hand painted quality.,5,5
414300,42,this makes my evaporative humidifiers smell so bad and the filter looks pink with mold within a few days of use. it is like the mold grows faster with this stuff. i followed the instructions and used the exact measurements. i do not recommend this what so ever.,5,5
54308,42,"this seller offers a good product at a fair price. the filters fit in my keurig and work to keep the water pure and fresh-tasting. besides this, the seller shipped the product so fast it was here before i expected it. i highly recommend!",5,5
551691,42,it's great and looks amazing. i was disappointed in the corners have slight openings. a better job could have been done by the manufacturer. all and all i love it. it has the bright and lower light setting. and the variable fan speed. just what i wanted.,5,5
627701,42,the metal is very thin compared to other covers. i have used them lightly and i have already dented them. spend a little more for better covers.,5,5
469145,42,"perfect replacement, easy installation and cool, clear water results. great product.",5,5
9606,42,it had an extra tab but fortunately it didn't affect the installation. plug & play + fast delivery. installed on ge signature series gas broiler.,5,5
380987,42,purchased this brand for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of taste it provides. the filters are made from a strong material that doesn't reduce the quality of the coffee. i will be purchasing these again and again.,5,5
16840,42,it slowed down the water flow drastically. i am ordering new samsung original. this did not work.,5,1
137896,42,works great for why i bought it! my regular washer broke. used this waiting for new set to be delivered. no complaints!,5,5
360711,42,my burner wire burnt out. ordered this kit and couldn’t be happier. exactly what i needed!,5,5
263096,42,"my dryer vent goes out of the roof (dumb). when my clothes would stop drying properly, i'd have to get my husband to go up there and clean the vent. rain, dew and humidity would cause the lent to clump up and not be capable of blowing out. we have a really steep pitch and my husband was sick of going up there. he ordered the system these filters go in and installed it in the garage. my dryer still wasn't drying properly. actually, it wasn't drying at all, really. he played with the system for a bit, finally pulling the filter out and told me to try it like that. my clothes are now drying faster than ever. the system itself has a screen in it. we just rub the lent off of the screen and call it a day. if you get the system, don't waste your time or money on the filters.",5,5
421441,42,i bought this for camping as i hate percolated coffee. this works just fine. use the #6 filter and if the drip slows just lift the filter a little to release the vacume.,5,5
551920,42,nga was wonderful to work with when i had a concern. returned my call immediately.,1,5
684876,42,the right side is not a dryer and will not fully dry your clothes. it just spins to get the extra water out of the clothes. be prepared to have to hang up your clothes to dry. but other than that it washes my clothes pretty good!,5,5
254951,42,the hood looks nice. it’s definitely on the noisy side and the suction is not that great.,5,5
76981,42,product received timely and works great! cheaper to do it myself this way!,5,5
624448,42,quality product for a good price. would purchase again.,5,5
463414,42,"ordered february 9th, installed february 12th, broke march 20th. a week outside of the return window. no way to return it.",1,1
590318,42,"very easy to install. i purchased all four for my kitchen appliances. love this especially with the pandemic that’s still in existence. call me paranoid. i have relatives & friends that are essential workers. i like knowing these are up & can easily be removed as well as washed & replaced. almost forgot to mention how soft they are, blends nicely & already received a few compliments. shared this item w/a few friends already & they’re interested in ordering this as well. great idea. thanks",5,5
532220,42,"a really good filter, we're very happy with this product",5,5
581703,42,worked great. saved a couple of bucks by doing so.,5,5
117071,42,purchased for my husband as his office moved to the keurig machine. he was not interested in the premixed coffee pods. he loves his new reusable coffee filter/pods. he can still blend his own coffee at work. great product! great value!,5,5
442887,42,"i have saved so much money already! i also love how sturdy, and durable it is, and i'm happy that i found something like this.",5,5
681329,42,easy to install. arrived quickly! great price! would buy again.,5,5
663764,42,"quality product, perfect fit. glad i bought them as my washing machine hoses were old.",5,5
424325,42,"only 3-stars because the listing is very misleading. the part i received is not a ge genuine part as stated, it was a robertshaw aftermarket. also, the picture shows the 2-pole mate-n-lok plug included, but the part did not come with it. it works so far, but i haven't had it installed long enough to know for sure how long it will last.",1,4
391768,42,perfect! it's compatible with all brew features on my 2. 0. way better than the knock off ones.,5,5
359282,42,"ice maker produces full ice cubes in the clearest capacity. quite running, very nice looking unit. produces more than we require in our daily use. so far it has been easy to keep clean.",5,5
379718,42,worked great at a good price.,5,5
463270,42,"it took several flushes to get the filter taste out of the water, but after that, it has worked well.",5,5
49987,42,this thing was an answer to a dream- the parts fit as they should have and in less than fine mins the dryer was up and running.,5,5
341931,42,tried to use these for another brand cook top specifically for d type stems. they were to small to fit. knowing either they could be loose or tight felt modification could be made with sims or reamed out unfortunaely the d design of these (straight side) is a metal sleve glued to inside of stem. if the inside of stem was molded for the d shape could of easily shave the opening to fit.,5,5
274069,42,"ease of installation-the only issue my son has, was that now he is burning all of his food by putting the stove settings on the old number he is used to and it is a lot more energy efficient than the 30 year old elements; lower the settings to start out — they heat quickly.",5,5
399135,42,prompt shipment. item exactly as described and works great!,5,5
162137,42,"flow goes good for about 2-3 minutes after the filter changes, then rapidly reduces to a mere trickle. have only had one filter where the flow rate was good!",5,5
203010,42,not bad for the price. 1st one came in broken,5,5
440764,42,got it immediately and install was a breeze - good price,5,5
399989,42,we have a keurig and use these all the time.,5,5
373849,42,really good match for our kitchen helps keep door handles cleaner,5,5
143989,42,i love this pitcher. works so fast,5,5
97004,42,"apartment living can mean dreaded trips to the laundromat but no more with this wonderful washer. given our lease, we wanted to be able to hide the washer and this will fit through any closet door 24"" wide or more. the side drain hose means you'll need at least 25"" width or 25"" deep by rotating sideways. assembly wasn't bad, just take your time and read the instructions. the hardest part was attaching the caster wheels. delivery was a 4hr window 10-2 and that's when it arrived. the guys carried it up 2 flights and i tipped them. this washer is amazingly quiet which is important and it holds more than i thought. it will fit a queen-size set of sheets plus 2 bath towels. it holds lots of underwear or shirts. the comforter and rugs will still need the laundromat. there are a ridiculous number of settings. the permanent press setting really did leave fewer wrinkles on dress shirts. the washer shuts off if you open the top door. be sure to empty the lint screens often. great price! tips: instead of trying to attach the end of the drain hose to the faucet attachment, just use the curved clamp to hook around the faucet base. definitely put the wheel locks on when it's running or it will try to roll away potentially damaging the faucet and attachment. as a portable, you get an extra faucet hose if ever needed. when washing with warm water, wait until it's filled and then turn off the warm water and turn on the cold water for rinsing. when it's done i just stick both hoses inside the washer which leaves the door slightly open to dry out. the manufacturer said this model is discontinued so you shouldn't wait while they're still in stock. complaints: too much styrofoam packing material! there shouldn't be any since styrofoam does not recycle. separate it from the recyclable cardboard forms and bag the nasty stuff for the landfill.",5,5
504848,42,"this is a great little washing machine that serves its purpose. i’ll start with the pros. pros: -fits in small spaces (16 inches wide) -fully automatic -not to loud -easy to use -pretty cute -led interior light -really good cleaning -doesn’t use much water -doesn’t need that much soap -really dries clothes to about 95%. clothes dry fast after being hung -changed our lives to have in until laundry cons: -the width is indeed 16 inches but you have to factor in the tubing on the side which is another inch and half. that puts you at 17. 5 inches wide. i had to drill a hole in the back on my machine to require the pump so it would fit in the space i had. -there is no timer on the machine so you have no idea how long your load has been in for -the high water level setting will leak. it’s simply took much water for the washing machine with clothes in it and it will overflow. stick to medium and low water level settings. -ultimately both the pump and the hose are comically short. you’ll need to buy replacements for both. that will set you back another $20. i would recommend at least a 5 foot hose and then a 6 foot pump. get someone who knows a bit about pluming to make sure the hose is secured on tight when you replace it. -can’t really use it out of the box. have to get all the extra parts and do some minor fixing. -you will also want to buy a quick release converter for your sink to make your life easier. that will set you back another $10. -the instructions make absolutely no sense. they are google translated from another language. -this model is more expensive than the giantex model that holds only 8 lbs of laundry and has a timer. if i had more space, i would have gone in that direction instead. also it’s $176 instead of the $250 this machine cost you.",5,5
311581,42,"i’m a chef, so the gold standard of cooking is gas. however, where i live gas is an extra expense that has to be stored on your own property in a tank. after much research, this was my next best option. i’m pleasantly surprised how much control i have with induction. changing the setting even one degree is immediate. the heat distribution is better than gas, because it encompasses the entire pan; not just the center. great stove top. the right bottom burner is the most commonly used, so i wish there was one more that size. the temptation to wiggle the pan on the stovetop is an adjustment that takes a minute. my old habit yielded a scratch in the first week. lesson learned. thankfully all my cast iron cookware works brilliantly on induction. if it’s not enameled, i recommend placing a paper towel under the pan while cooking. slight scratches are now forming as with all glass cooktops, but it’s much easier to clean than a conventional glass cooktop because the burner itself doesn’t heat up; only the pan. just maybe there’s a new gold standard in stovetops.",5,5
691323,42,installed in 30 minutes and saved the day,5,5
590362,42,works perfectly for a fraction of the cost of the samsung version. remeber you have to reset the water filter indicator yourself.,5,5
677699,42,"it is installed and working great, time will tell about quality.",5,5
504930,42,product is good for the price.,5,5
251764,42,"this item was an exact match for my frigidaire, i really needed it. however the price was definitely excessive.",5,5
555539,42,great product. worked well for me. second re-order,5,5
341574,42,for my aunt and she loves them!,5,5
394168,42,"great product and price, very easy to install.",5,5
83436,42,price was right but the original filters are for water and ice.,5,5
619250,42,it did what it supposed to do and came quick,5,5
599095,42,i found that this product worked as advertised and was very easy to use.,5,5
125467,42,didn’t work very well. it’s flimsy and doesn’t fit where it needs to go.,1,1
254383,42,"the purple ones work in my keurig 2. 0. not the black ones. (? ) lose a star for that. i'm still saving tons of money by not buying disposable kpod coffees. i still use the black ones for loose tea, just drop them into my mug. i can easily then compost the grinds and leaves.",5,5
348445,42,awesome for small pump parts to not get lost,5,5
17024,42,"i love coffee and i love my technivorm moccamaster coffee maker. thus, i love these melitta filters as they are an integral part of the process. they fit perfectly and i have no complaints. i have tried generic coffee filter brands out of desperation in the past and they aren't as good. i swear i can taste the paper or that i'm slowly being poisoned by anthrax if it's not melitta.",5,5
431927,42,these valves seem to work okay in my maytag dryer.,5,5
474246,42,this was an inexpensive and easy fix that should allow me to get a few more years out of my dryer.,5,5
679706,42,"for better or worse, this is an exact replacement of the part that broke in the first place. it would be nice if someone would make one that's reinforced or something.",5,5
590054,42,this spray arm fits perfectly in our dishwasher and was easy to just push into place to replace the broken one,5,5
49076,42,"spend the money on these, they work great and last. i have thrown away all of my cheaper ones.",5,5
306549,42,product was received quickly and exactly as described. customer service even checks to be sure you are satisfied. i would recommend this product to others.,5,5
284299,42,good price and easy to install.,5,5
218771,42,"this is super easy to read from a distance. it happened to work with the magnetic strip on my dishwasher. if i needed it, it came with double sided sticky tape.",5,5
332360,42,"great replacement for my ge refrigerator, a lot less expensive then the manufactures filter",5,5
62201,42,great for keeping fingerprints off of the refrigerator and oven handles!,5,5
369772,42,i lol’d when i opened the package. as flimsy as a piece of cardstock paper and it didn’t even fit.,1,1
349196,42,this magnet is just what i needed. my only complaint is that i wish it came in different colors. this is pretty enough but it doesn't match the rest of my kitchen. it does help the grandkids to know if they can use the dishes inside my dishwasher or if they should get one from the cupboard.,5,5
260812,42,garbage. worked as intended for 11 months then suddenly went bad.,1,5
590884,42,only issue is that the old grounds are annoying to get out. otherwise works great,5,5
16399,42,"parts work as designed, great filter for my fridge",5,5
258523,42,awesome shipping time and price. so nice to wash clothes again,5,5
120865,42,wonderful alternative to k-cups which are more convenient but unfortunately more expensive. we have reduced our coffee expense drastically.,5,5
456465,42,"got my k-cup brewers at a great price, fast service, and beautiful color! perfect transaction!",5,5
459648,42,"the element arrived promptly and in working order (i tested it with a multimeter before installation). unfortunately this was not our issue and we had to replace the entire oven. returning the item was quick, easy and painless.",5,5
371898,42,used it to fix a counter top stove and worked very well,5,5
332372,42,very convenient to use. easy set up.,5,5
136013,42,"love it, looks great with my kitchen decor",5,5
108824,42,"easy to install on my lg fridge, takes 30 seconds! great value and love that it’s a 2 pack, which lasts me a year!",5,5
197727,42,fixed my chest freezer with this last year and it's still going. saved me a lot of money.,5,5
335845,42,helps with the mold not sure if the filter will last longer. made the cheap filters last a little longer as well,5,5
199912,42,exact match. works perfectly. fast shipping,5,5
492082,42,"beautiful ice maker, nicely packaged. doesn't take up too much space and works fast! not very noisy at all. this is a great addition to my kitchen.",5,5
97895,42,"we were doing great until i broke my bonavita. better than the non-white ones, though, in my mind.",5,5
623123,42,fit perfectly in my lg fridge. water tastes great. you get 3 filters for 1/2 the price of 1 manufacturer's filters. the info on these filters says they will last longer than the manufacturer filter but haven't had it long enough to tell.,5,5
511901,42,so much better than the standard samsung filter. warning: you probably won’t be able to install the manufacturers filter. i’ve tried three different times when replacing filters. never works. i’m not breaking my several thousand dollar fridge to fit a stupid oem filter. this fits like a dream and works just as good for a fraction of the price. buy this you won’t be disappointed.,5,5
279974,42,"i own a single cup pod coffee maker. i find that it is most economical to use my own ground coffee versus the more expensive pods. my coffee maker came with a reuseable pod holder. this coffee scoop is so much easier to scoop and pour the coffee into the pod. before this scoop, i just scooped the pod into my coffee can and hoped i got enough or not too much coffee. i like the lid that comes down over the scoop to form a funnel that directs the coffee into the pod with no messy spillage and the scoop has the perfect amount of coffee to fill the pod. clean up is easy, i tap it and it is clean. i can always opt to wipe it out with a cloth or paper towel or rinse it off. over all, i am very satisfied with this scoop. all good pros and no cons.",5,5
488937,42,"the original element had an embossed part number on the mounting plate. this allowed me to purchase the exact replacement. this heating element is indistinguishable from the original - identical mounting method, connections, and performance.",5,5
192237,42,perfect! i have a stainless steel washer and it looks like it is actually part of the machine itself. very well made and strong magnet.,5,5
152356,42,this is a good kit other than the fact the idler pully is worng. be sure to order whirlpool 8547174 idler pully when ordering this kit. will save you alot of time and hassle.,5,5
257789,42,just installed the filter that's why i gave 4 stars for value. the filter looks and feels like it's made well and installed easily and has no weird taste and price is right,5,5
285883,42,this product broke right after the last day to return. i went to get a return started but it was just barely too late. for the price i really expected it to last at least a little while. the fit was tight so i had a feeling it would break off. i do not recommend buying this product.,1,1
30136,42,easy to install. fit like a glove.,5,5
180194,42,"exact fit, easy to instal, and this was the repair my dryer needed to work. the only negative was the packaging, they were shipped in a large envelope which allowed the metal connectors to bend before instal. i bent them back and they work great.",5,5
275549,42,"no leaks and easy installation. i feel a little better with a braided hose as opposed to a rubber one, i don't honestly know if one is better than another but the steel hose looks cooler.",5,5
441587,42,"the washer works great but the 'dryer' was broken and did not spin. i went through amazon to return but i have to send the defective product back, which is a pain because it's a bigger item and i don't have the box anymore. i also messaged the seller after going through amazon and they were going to replace or refund me if i send a video, so i would suggest going through the seller first if you need to replace. i'll update when i get a replacement, hopefully when the dryer works.",1,1
323801,42,"can’t beat the price, what i pay for three i can’t even buy one at local big box store.",5,5
537180,42,great little counter top ice maker. quickly makes ice and fairly quiet with only the dumping of ice noticable. first unit came in and ran great for about 2 days and stopped working. called amazon and they replaced it in 3 days and we're very nice about it. would have been quicker but it was on a holiday. i didn't even have to send the broken unit back!,5,5
374294,42,"these filters are easily cleaned and reused, making it much more earth friendly to use a keurig.",5,5
612732,42,they are huge! . i am using them to filter my water-based paint rinse water after i treat it with aluminum sulfate and lime. these work great in my big funnel. i also use them to strain yogurt to make it creamy like greek style and to drain tofu.,5,5
271934,42,excellent reusable kcup pods. easy to clean. excellent price.,5,5
70740,42,"got this to replace the broken cord on my frigidaire fgid2466qf5a, works great if a tiny bit longer than the original. kind of pricey but you don't have much of a choice. easy to install.",5,5
515516,42,"just what we needed. our original one came loose in the dishwasher and melted, so we were very happy to find this replacement on amazon.",5,5
581784,42,exactly as promised. installation was a breeze.,5,5
163003,42,"this device seemed like a great idea so everyone in the house would know the status of the dishes in the dishwasher. however, it fell apart about two months after we purchased it, through no fault of our own. buyer: beware!",5,5
95778,42,"this kit does not include the metal brackets needed for the 2019 model samsung washer and dryers (at least not for the wf45r6100a that i purchased). the recommended skk-8k samsung kit includes the metal brackets in this kit (which i did not need and ended up tossing) as well as a newer bracket which i did need. since the samsung kit includes both, i assume this kit would work for some model washers that recommend the skk-8k, but not all of them. otherwise, this parts seem high quality, very similar to the actual samsung kit, just unfortunately won’t work for everyone.",5,5

638173,42,"i live in a rural area. my dryer vent from the back of my machine went basically into a hole on the floor. it was jimmy rigged to stay, and also allowed my little mouse friends to come and go all winter. trust me even with a closing vent outside, they have always figured out how to get in. i installed this in five minutes and it is a strong secure but easy on off venture for cleaning the dryer vent. no hassling with the screw dryer etc. it's all metal and the magnets are strong but not too strong to make it too hard to take off when needed, and this is coming from a petite under five foot female. i do not want to struggle with my washer and dryer! i personally did not need to mount to the floor as the bottom fit securely to work in the vent hole. i don't write reviews unless i love something on amazon. this product is sturdy and good craftmanship and you will have it beyond the life of your current appliance",5,5

351086,42,"good price on this, and fits most small tub models. all the ports are filled in and you cut them out as needed which is nice, just make sure you save the nozzles from the old gasket. only drawback was the box it shipped in. they folded it over twice instead of shipping it whole which created some nice creases and ripples making the fit challenging (and i fix appliances for a living). if it was shipped correctly i would give 5 stars. the inner portion of the gasket was rubbing the basket upon install, and now i'm running a sanitize cycle which should form the gasket back. save your money on the useless lg spring tool and just use a good pair of fine needle nose pliers to get the inner spring clamp back on (it will require some effort, unfortunately)",5,5

455573,42,this is a sturdy and very adjustable option. i feel it’s the best pick of the available options and a real 5* product because: this is very durable because it’s made of strong materials. even the suction cup is a thicker better quality than you often see- even the screw that threads into it is thicker and strong. you can clearly tell the manufacturer cares about quality not just making a buck cutting corners. i feel it will easily last for many many years. this is fully adjustable as far as how wide you can prop the door and this is really handy for me. it doesn’t take up much room and it would be hard to lose. it’s easy to use- even a kid would be able to easily position and use this. i looked at a few ways to hold the door open on my lg front loading washer and i’m sure glad i did. i used to just leave it open and flapping and it would bang into the door when i went into the laundry room. it’s led to a much drier interior and it happens much faster and i don’t have to worry about the door closing too much and getting yucky nasty smells and mildest odors anymore. i have a lot less cleaning out i have to do now and washer always smells great. and my door is sure appreciative that it’s not longer being abused! and for nothing - customer service was amazing! they have great customer service and fast too. i had a missing part - suction cup- and it actually seemed may have been amazon’s fault (open package). these are carefully checked by the maker and so i’m awfully certain this is a very rare occurrence. the seller immediately replied to my issue and then sent me a new one right away and was very sweet and included two sizes and a personal note. they went far above and beyond.,5,5

302756,42,"this is the dishwasher for you if you like having to remove water from it with a wet vacuum or leaks! really wanted to like this portable dishwasher but it is a huge fail on too many levels. the literature it comes with needs a lot of work. they tell you in the online ad that you can hook it up permanently like a full-size dw but nothing about that is mentioned in the literature. it is possible though, you just need to find the right adapter at your local big box store. now, the lines it comes with have plastic connectors to the back of the dishwasher, very chintzy. cheap. and if you try to use any kind of pliers to tighten them, just don't because you run the risk of cracking them. we did plumb ours in like a regular dw, it was connected to the garbage disposal dw connection, and plugged into the gfci outlet under the sink cabinet. the dw comes with a normal, heavily soiled, and lightly soiled cycle (20-minute one), with high hopes ran a ""test"" cycle, the 20-minute one. this thing is about as noisy as most dishwashers when it starts to run. 12 minutes into the cycle it started to discharge the water (or so we thought). we waited for the end-of-cycle indication and opened the door only to find it was filled with water at the bottom of it, not a little bit of water, but a whole lot. had to use a wet vacuum to remove the water. for the first cycle, we had it connected to an extension discharge hose (a normal size one because the hoses that it comes with for the discharge are not normal size). check the manual reasons it might not discharge. according to the manual, possible causes are: 1) kinked discharged hose. checked the hose. no kinks. 2) stopped up sink drain. check drain. totally clear. 3) dw filter clogged. no dishes are in the dw so there was nothing to clog any filter. after removing the water with a wet vac, we decided to run another test cycle. in the second cycle, we removed the extension discharge hose and connected the dw directly to the garbage disposal dw connection just using the discharge hose the dw came with and a dw rubber adapter (the kind one would normally use). ran the 20-minute cycle again, and 12 minutes into the cycle it started to throw an e4 error. look at the error codes in the manual, and find out it means ""overflow"". seriously? according to the manual, possible causes: ""some element of the dishwasher leaks"". smh. at this point, we cut power to the dw, open the door and the bottom is full of water again. used the wet vac to remove the water, and pulled the dw forward while keeping it level and it is leaking from the bottom. the manual tells you to ""call for service"" if an overflow occurs. really? have not even been able to use it once normally and one needs to call for repair service? it is a piece of junk. at this point, we are over this fiasco. not worth it! i did go back and re-read other reviews and this appears to be a common issue that other customers have reported experiencing with it even when just connected directly to a faucet. it has been processed for a return! save your sanity, time, and $$$. pass on this one!",5,1

427962,42,"i read a number of fairly negative reviews of this product. they caused me concern, but i am very happy to say that this product does exactly what i want without any fuss or bother. i've had my vue for over a year. in fact, i have two. keurig (green mountain coffee roasters) discontinued the vue some time ago and have slowly reduced the variety of beverages available for the vue. that's really too bad since the additional capacity of vue cups permits brewing full strength coffee in 12, 14, or 16 oz quantities. one product i particularly loved was the sweet ice tea. it was an incredibly convenient way to make a single glass of iced tea in under a minute. all you do is take a 20oz glass, fill it with ice, insert the ice tea vue cup in the brewer, selected iced drinks/tea and start. it produced a perfect glass every time. one of the first casualties when keurig discontinued the vue brewer was the sweet and unsweet iced teas. i was not a happy camper. then i read about this product. i ordered a box of kcup lipton sweet iced tea and when the k2v arrived, i just took a kcup, placed it in the k2v, pressed down so the needle in the adapter could puncture the kcup, and then brewed the iced tea exactly the way i would with the vue cup. the results were perfect! brewing kcup coffee is also possible. please bear in mind that the reduced amount of grounds in a kcup will not brew full strength coffee in you brew more than 10 ounces. other than that, results are perfect. i didn't try the gold filter cup that comes with the k2v (it lets you use your own grounds). frankly, that makes no sense to me. there are a lot easier ways to brew a single cup of coffee with your own grounds than trying to force a vue brewer to do it. go to a starbucks and watch them brew ""poured"" coffee. so, if you want the ability to take advantage of kcup variety and still hang on to your keurig vue brewer, this device is a perfect way to do it.",5,5
342973,42,"i was pleasantly surprised to get these and i compared them to the factory filter and they look identical. to be fair, i brewed a couple of cups of coffee to see how they would do. 1. regular ground folgers coffee: worked perfectly no issue 2. medium ground vietnamese coffee: worked perfectly no issues 3. espresso finely ground coffee kicking horse coffee: worked perfectly no issues i'm so happy to report that these are just like the factory filter and held up to all brewing tests leaving no grinds and didn't have any clogging issues. the coffee tested in both the factory filter and these replacements looked and tasted the same. i highly recommend the product, you get 4 filters that are priced nicely. cheers and vidimo se!",5,5

83033,42,"i had a haier washer in the past which i gave away when i briefly moved to an apartment with a washer/dryer. then i moved again to an apartment without and knew i had to buy another one. i went with this one because it seemed to have more capacity than the haier, which also happened to not be available anymore. i like this a lot more. the haier seemed very unstable due to the wheels and build overall and often the spin cycle went off balance and the drum would start banging/shaking. this one is very stable and the spin cycle is unbelievably quiet. it also seems to remove more water on the spin cycle than any washer i've used in the past, making it much easier to dry your clothes. i bought the costway mini dryer with it and that seems to work well too. i also like that this has many different programs to choose from. you have the option to select two rinse cycles or just one. currently, filling the washer has been kind of tricky for me since the inlet hose doesn't fit any of my faucets, but i am working on a more permanent solution for that. in the meantime, it is possible to manually fill (albeit more cumbersome). i have found that a water siphon (the kind you use for aquarium water changes) works well with one end placed below your faucet and the other end into the washing basin to avoid having to fill and pour with a bucket. bear in mind, this is for smaller than standard loads of laundry, but i found i can fit way more in this one than a 1 cubic foot capacity portable washer. if you have a small family and like the convenience of having your own washer, this is it. using communal laundry machines seem very unappealing to me, especially during covid, so this is a great solution.",5,5

440158,42,"filters are one of those products that you have to accept manufacturer published specs for. there's no practical way to test these without the resources of a lab. it's all about trust. ge is a major player, has a ~130 year history and like many large and established us companies is highly process driven, innovative and fully embraces quality control and data driven results. the published specs for their mwf filter are below. one huge caveat: the ge appliances sub-brand is now owned or controlled by chinese company haier and kkr, a global investment firm. unknown how much of the typically high performing and capable ge culture and run rules will remain intact over the long run. i have no reason to believe that the amazon premium mwf filter is more or less effective than ge's but cost no object, i'd go with the ge filter simply because of trust. i like that the ge pharmaceutical filtration is third party tested. if i lived in an area where water management is suspect or in a heavily populated area with who knows what being flushed or otherwise sent down the drain to a water management plant, i'd go with the ge. the level of filtration you need goes hand in hand with how well your local municipality does with water management. the city i live in is diligent about water quality and publishes an annual and detailed report of the testing. they test for thousands of contaminants. in other words, the water in my area is most likely safe for consumption. not true in all areas. if your water is managed by a transparent and professional municipality, is well funded and staffed, going with a 'lesser' filter than the ge is probably ok. filter performance in my case is more about filtering out hard water taste. so, should you buy the amazon filter? i'd say yes if you trust those that manage your water quality. the amazon premium filter seems to filter out taste as well as the ge. both this and the ge are rated for 6 months/300 gallons usage. lt fits well and doesn't leak. cautiously recommended. the amazon filter specs are above in the advertising. ge specs below. ge mwf specs: filter life 6 months max. filtered water flow (gpm) 0. 5 filter media carbon block operation water pressure (psi) 40 min. - 120 max. nsf/ansi 42 yes nsf/ansi 53 yes pharmaceutical filtration - claims tested/verified by independent laboratory, not certified by nsf international or state of ca yes state of ca certified yes asbestos reduction >99% atrazine (herbicide) reduction 94. 5% benzene reduction 96. 7% chlorine taste and odor reduction 97. 5% cysts reduction 99. 99% lead reduction 99. 3% @ 6. 5 ph and 99. 3% @ 8. 5 ph lindane reduction (a pesticide) 99% mercury reduction 93. 2% @ 6. 5 ph and 93. 2% @ 8. 5 ph nominal particulant class 1 99. 7% p-dichlorobenzene reduction 99. 8% tetrachloroethylene 96. 7% toxaphene reduction 93. 2% atenolol 99. 5% endrin 97. 1% fluoxetine 99. 4% ibuprofen 94. 1% progesterone 99. 5% trimethoprim 99. 5%",1,5

300869,42,"while it will take a while to recoup the initial cost of this versus buying paper filters, the ease of use and not having to worry about filters tearing or the water knocking down a side and letting grounds run into the brew make it all good. the solid stainless steel construction make a good platform which fits nicely into the brew basket. i have always enjoyed the taste of the coffee through these types of filters as it allows some of the oils and flavors of the beans filter in unlike a paper filter which always absorbs them. now this is strictly a choice on your cup of coffee but, it’s my opinion. clean up, once you get used to dumping out the grounds and then rinsing the filter becomes less burdensome than just dumping the whole filter in the compost pile each day. does it take more time, yes, about a minute at most. the best thing is knowing that you don’t have to use a paper towel for a coffee filter because you forgot to buy filters…it’s always there.",5,5
503599,42,you can't go wrong with this price. i got the subscription price and saved so much money compared to buying it straight from frigidare.,5,5
632855,42,these are much better quality than the crap knobs samsung uses for their appliances. just about every original knob had broken at the base or had melted. these are way better in quality and samsung should really look into replacing their knobs with these.,5,5
584235,42,"purchased to fix our samsung dryer, it’s been over 6 months now and it’s still working like it’s brand new. it dries our clothes better than ever. i wouldn’t say it was easy to install but it could have been worse considering neither me or my boyfriend are experts with any appliances.",5,5

342418,42,it did what it’s supposed to do! stopped my washing machine from dripping water,1,5
556061,42,"the last two filters i purchased don't seem to connect correctly. 6 months ago it actually stopped working and caused the water line to freeze up. i installed a new filter last night and ran two pitchers of water through the filter. this morning my son filled his waterbottle without issue. now the panel is stating ""replace filter dispenser off"". no matter what we do we can't get the new filter to work. i'm glad we got a filter bypass after our last issue. i guess we'll go that route from now on.",5,5

624024,42,only one of the 4 wheels fit the shafts so they were totally useless. the holes for the shafts were undersize. fortunately the white idler pulley worked. had i the opportunity i would have sent everything back but i had the whole dryer apart and had to make the best of it. highly disappointed!,5,1

692748,42,"easy to install. reasonable price, fast service and an exact replacement for original filter.",5,5
536096,42,we bought ice bags with this to store ice in the freezer. i don’t know if it’s needed but we use distilled water to hopefully save components due to our hard water,5,5
505744,42,"loved the price, very affordable. quick delivery and works great.",5,5

481459,42,bought to replace the same item which finally gave up after 24 years. works great. tickled to see that the vent is exactly the same as my original one.,5,5
256687,42,this is a great tool. tried the hairdryer approach but this worked. had to apply a syringe full 3x as our line had been frozen a while.,5,5
627334,42,great product. produces strong and great tasting coffee and is not wasteful.,5,5
436627,42,fit like it was suppose too,5,5
536153,42,this lint catcher was well made. it works great in our dryer.,5,5
508579,42,i have tried other filters and they have leaked. this filter gives the best water and i have never had any leaking issues. the price is also thankfully so affordable. this is a great product.,5,5
383417,42,i love this dishwasher basket. keeps my utensils in place so convient,5,5
518227,42,"amazing little machine! so many settings allow for any type of load. small and light, but tub is large, has lint filter, and handles normal sized load. the motor and pump are sturdy and powerful. light weight, but i got little ""mover's dolly"" for $7. 00 for easy rolling from across room, and a faucet adapter for $15. 00. for easy snap on connection. paid for self in about 5 months, of no going to laundromat, and the saved time and effort of those trips is heaven!",5,5
223385,42,"works like a charm. fast service and it is exactly what i needed! i was a bit worried when i saw the package because it said whirlpool corp on the bag, but i was ordering a handle for a maytag, but it's all good!",5,5
622127,42,"these axles are fantastic! i used them to replace the melted, broken and no longer functional axles for my ge profile dishwasher (pdw9000 - part number for the wheel pack is wd35x21041). these fit beautifully, and i didn't need the wheels, just the axles. the old ones were useless. they had broken off, folded under the rack, melted, cracked, flaked and were otherwise completely worthless. the design of the originals was horrible, as was the detergent dispenser that was part of the original design of the dishwasher. i didn't use that for more than a couple of weeks before i was so grossed out by the thing that i stopped using it. there was no way to flush or clean it. it clogged very easily, with no way of unclogging it. it was disgusting. the thing still disturbs me. even though i haven't used it in at least 5 years. anyhow, the axles are great. they take a bit of elbow grease to remove from the wheels. i used a flathead screwdriver to compress the middle spring to release the post and take out the axle. i then replaced the new ones and pushed them into the wheel until they clicked, and then pushed them into place on the rack, until they popped. i now have a rack that is functional again, that rolls easily, and that i can use without using naughty language.",5,5
266549,42,we were in need of a replacement as we went over the 6 month filter that cake stock with the new lg fridge we bought. my know it all uncle (love him to death) decided to get a knockoff brand instead of paying for the exact filter that came with the fridge. anyways fast forward to the next filter change and i can’t seem to get this one to fit. even more horrifying right before i decided to change the current filter i noticed a oil in the water. it almost looked like plastic or some kind of oil that i’ve never seen before. anyways went to go screw in the replacement filter and no matter how hard i tried it wouldn’t go in. upon examination of the old filter it looked like it was forced into the socket and when comparing replacement filter with current one you can note the damage to the current filter. needless to say i opted out for paying for the lg version and we will see if it goes in like butter. who knows how long we were drinking that oil water for before i noticed. be careful when your trying to save money by buying knock off brands people.,5,5
571707,42,i was today years old when i ordered this from amazon. not only disease bring a pup to your kitchen appliances it’s also cutting down on fingerprints all over my refrigerator. i haven’t had to wash them yet and i am a little bit concerned that the velcro may not be a strong after wash but i’ll come back and let you know,5,5
464149,42,excellent product. give a serious built in look to our stove that has a half inch gap on each side. five stars if it was a little wider.,5,5
290907,42,"there are instructions on the filter that states it can be washed using hot water and detergent. i simple used the faucet to flush the grease off and soaked it twice, and its new again! i had been using it for a year and oil built up and started dripping ( i am into chinese cooking). i read the reviews and decided it wouldn't be worth trying to wash based on other comments. so, i ordered a filter which was refurbished with a lower price than a new filter but still around $15. it arrived and it was crooked and not a dome shape at all. so i decided to try washing the old one see if it would work, and it surprisingly did! soak it in the sink for a couple hours, and the detergent cleans the sink at the same time. i would never buy another filter again! save your hard earned money by simple washing it under hot water and detergent!",5,5
648847,42,it’s soft to the touch and laid down flat instantly. it fit perfectly and stays in place. it cleans up with a wipe from the wash cloth and still looks like the day i installed it. very nice product.,5,5
475036,42,we had cracked our crisper drawer by closing the refrigerator door while it was open. this fits it perfectly. very pleased.,5,5

35940,42,"i wanted a inexpensive way to brew coffee in my hamilton beach single cup machine using these reusable filters. however, every cup of coffee, no matter what brand, was weak and watered down. clearly not worth the investment.",5,5
416270,42,works and fits well no concerns excellent price,5,5
399581,42,very nice quality and very fast shipping. pitcher looks the same as the picture. anybody can order it you will get a quality pitcher.,5,5
584517,42,"works better than the one that came with my fridge, hopefully it lasts longer",5,5
544590,42,doesn't seal well when closed but opens freely and allows for air flow as it should.,5,5
57928,42,"so far so good. it looks like the whirlpool filter which was made in mexico vs. the tier1 which is made in china. ultimately, time will tell if it measures up.",5,5
586295,42,when i went online and searched the part that i needed they had the cheapest price also i received the part quickly and it was the quality part that i needed,5,5
564248,42,pretty simple item. nothing special about it. did fit right and did align right when closing which is good cause i have some bad ones over the years,5,5
625895,42,you get a different item then this. it is not the same as the picture and does not include the parts listed there are half of what is listed. plus it was an open item that i received not a brand new one. listing is just wrong on so many levels. not worth the savings since you will loose money sending it back to get your money back. awful seller.,1,1
687086,42,completely nice looking shelf with a door on it - that's what i have left. worked fine for a few weeks. then stopped completely. no warranty support - i'd have to pay to ship it back and forth to have someone examine it to see if they could fix. never will purchase another igloo product. i have a completely useless refrigerator in my office now - a stainless steel cabinet with a door on it.,1,1
354099,42,"only thing i can complain about is the fact it's only a 2 inch by 1/4 inch product that was shipped in a big ol bag haha other than that, cheap good fuse. worked great and fixed my issue.",5,5
102988,42,"saved i don't know how much money replacing this myself in our freezer. works perfectly, so happy!",5,5
148622,42,"i bought this dishwasher because i am almost never home, doing it by hand uses a lot of water. did i mention that i'm lazy when i get home? build quality from the outside is okay it looks nice but the sheet metal is thinner than what you find on a refrigerator or stove. so in other words kind of delicate. the led display that shows the time remaining is visible when the door is opened, but when you close it you have to look between the door and the frame to see it which is kind of annoying. the inside frame is good, spacious for its size. from top to bottom is the same size as a built-in dishwasher, from side to side is about 4 to 6 inches shorter then a built-in dishwasher. the top and bottom metal racks have a durable coating on them. my only concern about the inside is that the top rack has a spray arm that completely detaches from the base in the back when you pull it out (which is normal). i wonder how long it will last before i have to replace the seal. if you follow the instructions that is given, it is pretty much straight forward and easy to install. the one thing that really surprised me. the sink attachment that they put in with it. it has threads on the outside and threads on the inside. it makes it a more versatile install pending on your sink faucet. overall i was impressed. the outer build quality was decent. the inner build quality was good. i got this a week ago. i have used it 4 times and the functionality was excellent. as for the price it's a little much but if i had went to a competitive store it would have cost me a $150 more.",5,5
89349,42,arrived quickly and was simple to install. works great.,5,5
197487,42,people love my water so i credit this filter.,5,5
122610,42,"i'd ordered in the past and now couldn't find the filters so i ordered again. just received the filters and when i pulled out the old filter, oh yuk. new filter installed and the water is back to clean and no added taste. great filters.",5,5
556718,42,"it does keep you from needing to vent to the outside, but keep in mind it will obviously cause dust to cover the side of your wall and dryer, and make the room warmer that you have it in, and, obviously it will be moist in that room after you dry lots of clothes. not sure why i thought it could be otherwise, because that is common sense. but i was desperate. i can't vent through the ceiling in my case, nor through the wall. it might work ok if you use it in a garage or basement where you don't mind dust. i minded the dust over the sides of my dryer and wall. i'm picky. so finally i removed this and now open the bathroom window and place the vent hose out the window and when i'm finished with the wash, i remove the hose and place in a basket beside the dryer. inconvenient, but not as much as beating clothes on a rock by the river and hanging the clothes on a line to dry, so there is that.",5,5
236108,42,it's a quick cheap fix until you can order a better quality product. only lasted 2 months before i had to replace it.,5,5
73670,42,please give me instrudtions where they go and how i can use them in my krups km720050 coffee pot. i have used krups coffee pots since 1992. they are excellent - but i also knew where to place the filter. h e l p!,5,5
244169,42,this item arrived quickly and exactly as described in its original packaging. it's difficult to find accessories for the original special edition keurig. someone inadvertently threw mine out and i couldn't find one through keurig! this works perfectly! it's nice to find a seller of genuine parts as there are a lot of counterfeits out there! do not hesitate!,5,5
305809,42,easy to use and works perfectly. loving it so far.,5,5
244461,42,this pos worked for like 4 days and quit. there are videos all over about these things failing right after being purchaesed. i want my money back!,5,1
301812,42,they work great on my older style kcup brewer.,5,5
632831,42,"like the washer, the gas dryer doesn't come with a gas hose (or dryer vent hose for that matter). can't use it until i get a hose. the lint filter is in an odd location and when pulling it out to clean, lint goes everywhere. not sure i would buy this again, but it does do what it is supposed to do.",5,5
320270,42,"these work better than anything else i have tried. nice strong adhesive around the rim, the lid has just enough overhang to fold all the way around. has a good finger lift tab for removal of lid after use. highly recommend!",5,5
197060,42,"i have used this type of sensor before but not mounted on a daughter board. i could only get this to work with the adafruit library, was to desolder and remove the capacitor on the board. after that, it worked well.",5,5
446212,42,this product worked perfectly as a substitute for the samsung water filter. no problems installing it. water tastes great! would not hesitate to purchase again.,5,5
544113,42,"perfect k cup, as i did not find any grounds at the bottom. super easy to clean and makes a better cup of coffee than the disposable ones in my opinion. definitely recommend!",5,5
330308,42,"beware when buying a ge profile filter, they use a chip on the unit, without this chip, you can't use the ice/water feature. super overpriced for subpar filters. we live in vegas, where water is loaded with minerals and chemicals. using tds meter, tap water reads, 468 ppm, our ro system reads, 18, using overpriced ge filter, reads120, considering we have high tds, 120 is average tap water. ro is better.",5,5
112454,42,i've had to reorder these bins three times and guess by the picture if it's right because the manufacturer number doesn't match any of the bins and they do not put the dimensions in the description which would be an enormous help. not every refrigerator is the same. please add the dimensions to prevent boxing up and sending back the product that doesn't work. it's annoying!,1,1
238860,42,worked great on my older whirlpool dryer abs easy to install. no instructions invluded but there are many videos on the net to guide you.,5,5
598929,42,my refrigerator doesn't make and store very much ice but now i have about double the amount. the only bad thing about these ice makers (all ice makers) is that they do not keep the ice frozen. the ice just melts and it makes more. so far this ice maker is working great and it is extremely quiet.,5,5
580304,42,worked great at a great price,5,5
533718,42,"great price, paid twice as much for the exact same thing at an ""outlet"" store! amazon wins again! fits great, works well.",5,5
23280,42,"do not buy! invest in a higher quality ul listed surge protector lasted about 6-8 months this morning alarm went off with refrigerator i muted alarm, lights were still on so i went back to my office. surge protector apparently burnt up and all i smell is burnt plastic and blackened white plastic where refrigerator plugs into unit. company: okura usa 1195 n. w. doral florida 33172 usa made in china; no ul markings whatsoever, i never noticed upon receipt and installation, i will not make that mistake again! unit as pictured was extremely hot when removed. advice people who are using this product, to pull and feel heat generated so you do not have potential for a fire on your hands. this is what america has turned into; everything manufactured in china. a qc pass sticker over one of the unit’s bottom left screw hole is meaningless. going to local box store or hardware store to buy a better unit. amazon should reconsider not to sell electrical products that have not been ul tested properly.",1,1
23444,42,this was super fast and easy to install! i did read the helpful comments from others (like put the clear plastic ring on the dryer end and the other on the vent itself before you connect the hose). i liked that the accordion hose went back down to a compact size when we pushed the dryer in (our vent isn't too far from dryer) instead of other hoses that are sloppy and misshapen after you extend them during install. super tidy design and works like a champ!,5,5
246279,42,"the part seems to be oem and saved us a service call. our dishwasher, a 10-year old maytag model that is listed on the seller's description is now back in service. our original door latch was white, but we got black and it looks more modern.",5,5
99778,42,the last one of these i had to buy cost over $85. i see nothing that would indicate cheap or poor quality. removed the old one with two screws and replaced with this new unit. the included ceramic wire nuts are especially convenient. oven is back in operation that quickly.,5,5
433531,42,our old ice maker was dripping water and freezing everything up inside. the ice would be one big block and the bucket was hard to pull out since it would freeze in. we bought this and watched a video online on how to replace. works great now with no issues.,5,5

51335,42,it has mold. do not buy!,5,1

9135,42,"i was thinking about getting a small freezer for several months. i wanted a frost free one but they only make those in larger sizes. when my area went on shelter in place, i decided on this one. i am happy with it. it has a good seal and keeps things frozen. the temperature adjustment is in the back of the freezer which took me a while to figure out and a bit inconvenient, but i left it at the default and my meats are still frozen solid after a couple weeks. it gives me as much space as the freezer on top of my fridge. i can tell if it is cycling but it is much quieter than my kitchen fridge. i am happy with my purchase.",5,5
32348,42,"i purchased this unit from laundry alternative's website. it arrived with minimal instructions and a large notice on top of the machine inside to remove the motor brake at the bottom before using. i was not sure what that would look like since there were no pictures and nothing on the bottom of the machine, but there was a metal bar laying loose in the bottom of the plastic bag. i installed the machine and ran it and it was very noisy. i emailed them and let them know all this and they said they would send me another machine. the noise had calmed down and i used it anyway. they sent me another boxed machine and i have been so busy and didn't open it until 3 weeks after receiving it which is today. it is a small washing machine. not the product i ordered. the extractor i have been running does not really extract very much water, i have a top loading hd washer so i don't know if the extractor is not doing the job because it is a poorly running product since it was not protected during shipping or if it is because i have a good washing machine but this whole thing has been very annoying.",1,1
566054,42,p self explanatory. love that they are unbleached,5,5
476046,42,originals were breaking so found these as replacements- they fit well and look nice. seem to be better quality than the originals.,5,5

590102,42,this is what i got in the mail seem to be missing a few things. do not buy,5,1

674527,42,"this works! installed it in october 2022. i followed the instruction to unplug the fridge before removing the lights. switched out the board and re-installed. 1 goes to the top of the refrigerator side, one to the bottom and last goes to freezer side. been 2 months and all are still working. saved a lot instead of buying the complete set with the housing.",5,5
812,42,fixed my maytag washer. a lot less expensive then i could get locally and faster too. thanks amazon,5,5
184295,42,"very easy replacement (once the dryer is fully disassembled). all connectors and fastener points match exactly. if needed, take a picture prior to removal and compare during reassembly. i had tried to only replace a blown thermal fuse on this unit. but years of heavy use and a nearly clogged vent pipe were causing the old unit to overheat and blow the fuse. after finding and cleaning the clogged pipe i might have been ok to replace the fuse a second time. but the cost of the whole unit is low enough to make risking yet another full disassembly and reassembly not with it.",5,5
12385,42,"i popped this into our pb911sj9ss range to replace the glass i broke while making some ciabatta recently. replacement only required a couple torx bits a 1/4"" socket, a driver, and about 10 minutes of my time. just be careful of sharp edges; not just when handling the broken glass, but when taking the door apart. i cut my fingers a couple different ways on the stamped steel interior panel you remove to access the glass, none of which was deburred. i would buy this again. i just hope i won't have to.",5,5
118648,42,perfect fit and works. what more could one ask for. thanks!,5,5
579753,42,"i bought this to replace a haier washer that was 4-5 years old. i like the features and options on this one. however, i feel like the true capacity (both 1. 6 cu ft) is not as much as the haier and it does not wash quite as well. items are clean but heavy soiled items sometimes don't get super clean if the washer is on the full side. its quieter though and again the options are great. overall i am pleased with it.",5,5

349765,42,"it is very heavy and well made, easy to use, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. it is super easy to remove the foil cap from one of your used pods, pack it with coffee, set the refill cap on it and it makes a beautiful cup of espresso. i followed other users advice and didn’t pack the coffee in tight and got a beautiful froth on top (as seen in picture), just like i would with a nespresso pod. the only downfall is that it just doesn’t make as great of a cup of coffee. i used two different types of coffee and experimented with packing the grounds or loosely filling the pod - either way, it produced a weak coffee - nothing like the rich tasting coffee you get with the pods. also, while the initial froth is rich is thick, it dissipates quickly and doesn’t have the thick creamy taste you get from the pods. overall, this is a great product and it will definitely be handy when i run out of pods or am looking to save a bit of money. unfortunately though, nothing beets the authentic pods.",5,5

33530,42,"i'm very pleased with this product and i'm sure you will be as well providing you don't confuse it with a full-size unit. the main reason i'm writing this is to mention, unlike the company's customer service department claimed, it will work without being directly connected to a water source. admittedly, it's easier if connected to a water line but not that much trouble to fill manually. here's how i do it: fill the tub up with water, add detergent, stir the water to mix, add clothes. next turn on power, select water height to high, press ""cycle button"" three (3) times for ""wash only, "" then press start. the wash cycle takes about 15 minutes to complete. once wash cycle is completed press power button turning off machine. next, push power button again to turn on. press cycle button five (5) times for ""rinse only. "" then press start, which drains the water out of the tub. after completed turn off machine and repeat the above ""wash only"" steps (listed above) but just fill with water. let clothes agitate in rinse water for about 5 minutes and push the power button turning the machine off. repeat ""rinse only steps"" (above). i rinse clothes two or three times this way. when finished push power button off. after rinsing is complete push power on, press ""cycle button"" six (6) times for rinse only, then press start. there you have it. i use a separate spinning unit to drying the clothes as much as possible before hanging them to air-dry. when drying this i use multiple plastic hangers (at least three) so as not to put marks in the clothes. thanks for reading my review and happy washing!",5,5

494302,42,"we use these motors to keep the bath and kitchen fans functioning in a 1962 apartment building. here are a few easy ways to make them work. but first, make sure you need a new one. take your motor out and spin the blade or cage by hand. also push and pull it in the direction of the shaft and see if it moves in and out of the motor enough to rub the housing or frame. most of the time, our noise complains are a function of the blade or cage coming loose and contacting some stationary metal part; or just needing shifted on the shaft to compensate for shaft loosening over time. if it all seems good, then remove the blade/cage and put a few drops of machine oil in the oil well (if so equipped) or drip in at the base of the shaft. now plug the motor in. if it doesn't spin easily, then you'll need a new one. our original kitchen vents run a clockwise motor. when we switch them over, we simply flip the fan blade and re-install. you can change the direction of the motor by disassembling and flipping the middle section, but this is definitely motors 201, so do so to your own comfort and at your own risk. flipping the blade is easier if possible. on our bath fans, we have a squirrel cage which is not reversible, but fortunately, the originals are ccw. however, these mount with studs on the shaft side, not the back side. so we simply remove the through-bolt (one at a time) and reverse them. the shaft length is not constrained in either of our fans, but if you have interference, just shorten the shaft with a cut-off wheel, hacksaw or whatever works for you. pull chain switches and bead chain are available on amazon. choose the switches that are at least partially metal. since this motor is the only style easily had, it's good to know how to creatively make them work in your application. i hope this is helpful to you.",5,4

453481,42,"here is what i found out. if you hear the clicking sound coming from your icemaker samsung imc 701 or ge da97-05422a, it has no serviceable electric parts so replace the icemaker. most likely the heater on the tray has failed. the clicking is the motor trying to turn the paddles against a mass of ice that has not been pre-empted from the tray for paddles to discharge the ice cubes. do not replace the motherboard if replacing the ice maker with clicking occurs. if the icemaker does cycle (paddles move to 3 oclock position facing it) with a clean ice tray then you may have a motor failure or something further up the line (in the motherboard). i went round and round on this and spoke with ge customer service. the bulletin by samsung everyone talks about on the internet is misleading. start with the icemaker, it is the cheapest solution and can be purchased amazon verified as of 3/15 for under $100. our ice maker lasted 7 years which is close to when all icemaker fail. it is a tough environment for motors and electronics in general. hope this helps someone. cheers!",1,5
15213,42,i bought this as my normal oem parts supplier (parts town) was showing this item as unavailable when i required a replacement. this parts was available at the same price i normally pay and as far as i could determine is an oem part. the only hard part replacing this item was removing the old one which was more stubborn than the same repair i have made with equipment in other locations.,5,5

(glad we got the new smudge-proof stainless finish on our frigidaire appliances. it shows a lot less fingerprints. ) i would have preferred a slightly less space-age style, but i didn't see anything more appropriate. we got cherry cabinets in a deep red/brown wood finish and stainless appliances for a kind of mixed traditional/modern style. maybe the similar akdy model with the flat glass would have worked better. . . should'a, could'a, would'a. that's my refrain for the first 6 to 8 months on all home improvement projects. after a year i get used to it, and wonder why i ever wanted anything different. same with new clothes.",5,5

263377,42,my baby is afraid of the spring door stoppers we have so we had to remove it and she plays with anything we put at the base of the door to prevent the door knob from hitting the wall so this was a great option to try and it really works! it fits the door knob itself and it matches her room and keeps the wall safe from when the door knob touches the wall. thank you!,5,5

230445,42,"paper filters are better. i bought this to avoid buying more paper filters, but this time i kept the lid open and watched what happened. the paper coffee filter would eventually spread out the coffee evenly in a layer, so all of the coffee was being used (ok) after i received this mesh filter, i again watched to check the coffee. with this mesh only the water stayed in the center (about a quarter coin size) and the coffee spread to the edges, so it was a waste of coffee not being used. with the paper the coffee spread into an even layer, with this flat bottom mesh there is just a bare screen for the water to pour through, moving the coffee to the outside edges. waste coffee i just went to the store and bought more paper filters instead.",5,1

206242,42,"we are on our 4 th auger motor! our first one went out 2 years after we had the refrigerator. i called whirlpool and asked to talk to an engineer, they refused. they said no one has called and complained, as i read 133 complaints on this unit, as a faulty motor! this motor was made in china and is a poor design. my husband is getting pretty good at changing them out! we are one our 4 th motor. last time we replaced the seal it seamed to last a little longer. it seams to be leaking and burning out the motor. the first time the repairman charged $250. 00! we are a retired couple and couldn't afford this repair. we would have paid for half the refrigerator. it is only 8 years old and the top off the line (gold series). not cheap! this has nothing to do with amazon, i'm just luck they carry this part! thank you amazon. we will never buy whirlpool or kenmore!",5,5

571104,42,"was easy to use and worked perfect! no more brownish-rusty dishwasher interior. looks brand new again! i used a dremel rotary tool, sanded off every speck of rust! sand any ""lumps"" (which are hidden ""rust dust"") to make sure no rust left behind! i sanded down to bare metal, cleaned every spot i sanded with rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad, twice. don't skimp on the prep! people who said it ""didn't work"" did not prep correctly! did 3 coats, almost the whole bottle. do it outside to see clearly and wear latex gloves. i let each coat dry 1 hour, then let finished rack dry 48 hours, before i did a load of dishes. i opened my dishwasher and all the brown was gone! yes the goop dries fast. keep a finger over the bottle. by the 3rd coat, it was getting so thick, i thinned with 1/2 teaspoon 100% acetone nail polish remover, capped and shook it good. exposure to air dries the goop quick! the trick is>>> don't ""brush"" the goop on — use the brush to quickly spread the goop along the wires. using a light touch — then back off and close the bottle! if you use extra brush strokes, it gets stiff and lumpy. keep bottle closed — every time you open the bottle to air, it gets thicker (and harder to spread). don't expect a factory coating — but it will be sealed. you hardly see the repairs! do the prep right. get every speck of rust off first, then wipe it down good with alcohol. read the instructions!",5,5

354187,42,"i have not attempted to install the timer device i received. i have concerns about the part that was sent to me and i'm not 100% certain the old timer is bad. my low rating for this product is due to several observations. 1) it arrived with no instructions but this device must be configured. it can replace several different timers. 2) most internet pictures show the timer shipping with mounting hardware. none was shipped with mine. 3) the ad indicated this is a ""whirlpool"" device (made by or for whirlpool). there is no way to identify where this thing was made, who made it, or who it was made for. no whirlpool markings, no ul, no csa, no nothing. i think the part shipped is a cheap knock-off and i'm not in any hurry to install it. be careful when you order this part to make certian you are getting the quality part you expect. i think i just got burned.",5,5

685531,42,"so you get what you pay for. for the price & what this does, it's fantastic. the spinner on my first one broke after 4 uses & they walked through the trouble shooter via email with me. they were fantastically polite & when all options failed to fix it, they replaced it for free. it works fantastic for my small loads. if you're a single person you'll probably wind up doing 2-3 loads per week, but the spinner gets everything nearly bone dry. if you don't feel like throwing them in a dryer, you can just hang them up overnight & they'll be good to go within a few hours! the water inlet hose doesn't fit any of my older faucets, so a 5-gallon bucket (like they kind you get from home improvement stores) fills the entire wash reservoir up to the ""high"" level. no wasting water & it gets my clothes even cleaner than my full-sized washing machine while using less detergent & energy. very good purchase & i couldn't be happier. i may get a higher quality one in the future, but i wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again.",5,5
77318,42,worked exactly as advertised. excellent value for price.,5,5

618412,42,"if i could give this 6 out of 5 stars, i would. 11/10. 100% satisfied. i live in a small apartment and my job has me working long hours. when i get home from work or on my rare day off i have a really hard time bringing myself to go do laundry at a laundromat. not that i mind doing laundry, but the sorting it, packing it up, hauling it all to a laundromat along with laundry detergent, paying $5+ every time just to spend about 1. 5 to 2 hours sitting and waiting for the laundry to finish all while it being around 10 or 11 at night? yeah, i put it off as long as i can every single time. like, until the only thing left to wear are the ugly christmas sweater and the shorts i've had since middle school level of put it off. after a while i started washing things by hand in the bathtub because i hated the laundromat process so much, but that was such a tedious process involving a plastic magazine file bin, kitchen tongs, and scalded hands. needless to say, it was a dark time where laundry was concerned. i was hesitant to purchase this at first due to price, but y'all, i wish i had purchased this sooner. it's so easy. it takes two minutes to wash things (but i double that because two minutes of washing feels weird), so i pop on a good song and spin it until it's done. the entire process can be done in the bathtub: the spinning, the draining, the rinsing, and then scoot it over and your drying rack can fit in there too. it takes a while to drain if the lid stays on (the instructions recommend keeping it on for hot water until it cools), but since i'm at home, i can just go do other things. if the water is tepid just pop that lid off and it drains quick. i'm not stuck staring at a spinning washer hoping someone doesn't steal my clothes. then a quick rinse, let it drain, dry your clothes, and go back to your day. it's hands-on work for only roughly 10 minutes. it's awesome. it fits a lot more clothes than i anticipated, too. i use those 13"" x 13"" cube bins as a laundry hampers for each type of clothes so they're already sorted, and the washer can fit pretty much an entire bin's worth of clothes. i was shocked at how much i could wash at once. even though it's expensive, a quick calculation showed it would pay for itself in 16 trips to the laundromat (and a trip to the laundromat runs roughly 2 loads of what this can handle), so that's basically 32 washes. but forget the money part. not having to deal with the entire process of going out to do laundry, and not having that chore hanging over my head basically at all times. that alone is worth it. i already have to spend all day every day outside of my apartment and i just don't want to leave my place on my days off. and with winter coming, laundry days lugging dirty clothes through nasty nyc street slush is *miserable*, but now i don't have to! plus, it's kind of fun! i'm actually looking forward to doing my laundry now. it's worth it to me to finally have a full closet of clean clothes and not losing things to endless pit of the ""dirty"" hamper! i am 100% a fan of this. if you have ever found yourself washing clothes by hand at any point, just do yourself a favor: buy this washer and thank me later.",5,5

633808,42,"it looks good, i wouldn’t say great. having a really hard time getting the chimney to be flush to the ceiling. the mounting bracket for the top chimney is as high as it can be mounted and it has a 1” gap between the top of the chimney and the ceiling. we are ductless, but i’d be even more unhappy if i could see the duct through the gap. the instructions are the worst i’ve ever seen. that’s after installing 3 faucets, 2 vanities, countertops, 3 sinks. you get the idea. none of the parts are labeled. i have no clue where to put the plastic dampers or if we even need them. the anchors that come with it are cheap and flimsy. one went right through the drywall. the instructions say use a 3/16” pilot hole for the anchors. we had to go two sizes bigger, there was just no way. it says drill a 1 1/4” hole for the power cord and then caulk all openings. how am i supposed to caulk a 1 1/4” hole? and the 2 piece chimney is not seamless either. installation took several hours by two people due to the horrible instructions. i have it a good review for auction power but we haven’t actually cooked under it yet.",5,1

89557,42,"whirlpool doesn’t want you to buy these instead of there everdrop 1 water and ice filter so they put a stupid sticker on theirs that your fridge will read. if you use this kenmore filter, the fridge blocks you from pushing it all the way in and closing the filter compartment door. they do this so they can charge four times as much per filter. but i’ll tell you a ‘secret’: those stickers are easy to remove and place on a kenmore. make sure you put it on the same place. so if you have a whirlpool filter 1 to start with, you can save money as long as you can transfer the old sticker. if i’d known about these shenanigans, i honestly would have bought a different refrigerator.",5,5

666696,42,"it's about time kitchen aid released this ""upgrade. "" the old rack-adjusters were junk. i replaced more of them then i can remember. this should have been the design from the start and kitchen aid should have issued a recall to fix these at no charge to us customers. that said, this new rack adjuster works great. it should last much longer than the old one. be sure to view the youtube installation video. it makes this job a piece of cake. do note that the rack positioners are installed backwards in the video as another reviewer highlighted. be sure the ""smooth"" side points to the inside of the rack. another note - the screws that hold the axles in place were a bit loose on the kit i received. a simple tightening made the entire assembly work a lot better. the axles have small tabs that go into slots on the metal rail so you don't need to hold them in place while tightening. be careful not to over tighten as these axles are plastic and you don't want to strip them.",5,5
490796,42,"read full review as i have two parts. i will preface this by saying that mine did spring a leak on the wash tub side, i'm sure i can open it up and caulk it, i'll update if i ever do with the result. for now i just have a cloth under the leg where the slow trickle is coming out. i contacted the company about this and they resolved it with a partial refund that could go towards me fixing it or a new machine. yes, the tubes are short, i have mine on a table and i cut down my house drain pipe. (this was a temp machine until we can afford a ""real"" one, but i'm not sure i even want a real one) i had to macgyver the inlet tube, i brought the tube and my sink connector to ace (yes, go to them, mine is family owned and amazing) and they hooked me up. (literaly? haha) you have to manually fill and drain, but i like that. i can choose specific temps and amounts and times. it has a gravity drain vs pump, which i also like, one less thing to break. spin dryer gets the clothes damp, we hang them outside in the summer and inside near a heat vent in the winter, theyre dry withen 1-3hrs on a good day, and most days are good. lint is an issue, wash like colors. this thing gets the clothes super clean. my water was quite dirty the first load, but after that the water wasnt as dirty with the same clothes, so, i conclude that my ""real"" machine (which was a big brand efficiant whatever) wasnt cleaning that great. i am choosing not to take a star away for the leak, this is a fantastic machine and the company also resolved it promptly.",5,5

282934,42,"i wrote my above review first, that's why the change ""in stars"" i don't hate either the general electric, hotpoint wb48t10011! again, the lack of stars is only because it didn't fit my oven and their return policy (which for the other rack i think i said warranty policy) basically said i was out of luck. here is a copy of the review i wrote for the above-referenced product. the rack was in perfect condition, however, probably my fault, it was too wide for my oven. i viewed their return policy. and not only have to travel to the post office (my only option is on a saturday before 12 pm because of where i live; and, actually the main reason is because i have to pay for the shipping, as well, and can't order a replacement that might work. in case you wondered, yes, i did measure the oven rack before i ordered. right, now, i'm thinking about using them as a plant shelf between two milk crates on my patio. anyways, my ""one star"" rating is only because of the above. if you've ordered oven racks before and know what you're doing (obviously unlike me), i would recommend this very highly. it looked brand new! the rack was in perfect condition, however, probably my fault, it was too wide for my oven. i viewed their return policy. and not only have to travel to the post office (my only option is on a saturday before 12 pm because of where i live; and, actually the main reason is because i have to pay for the shipping, as well, and can't order a replacement that might work. in case you wondered, yes, i did measure the oven rack before i ordered. right, now, i'm thinking about using them as a plant shelf between two milk crates on my patio. anyways, my ""one star"" rating is only because of the above. if you've ordered oven racks before and know what you're doing (obviously unlike me), i would recommend this very highly. it looked brand new!",5,5

285272,42,it is easy to install and allows for freezer to work properly during cold weather,5,5
108706,42,i really enjoy these they last a very long time and filter great. they will stain with the coffee but i haven't noticed that affecting the flavor in-between coffees at all. i don't think i will be going back to paper filters anytime soon definitely encourage anyone to give them a chance if you want to do more reuse stuff!,5,5

156796,42,"i’ve been using these with reusable k-cup pods for over a year. they fit the pods perfectly and i never have coffee grounds in my cup, nor do they impart any taste to the coffee. if you want to save the planet from a mountain of single use plastic k-cups these work well with the reusable pods. this combo will also save you a bunch of money!",5,5

54038,42,"i bought a brand new stainless steel stove and immediately ordered these covers since stainless steel can scratch when cleaned. they are a life-saver. i totally covered the burner areas after cutting out for the burner and if stuff overflows, they clean up very easily and look great again. get these to save yourself a lot of cleaning because of burnt stuff on the stovetop.",5,5

269671,42,i bought this refrigerator for my enclosed patio. it is great for the warm weather because i didn't have to keep going inside to get a cold drink. it was also nice for the free shipping and having it delivered to my front door.,5,5

191882,42,"everything is fine. but i had intended to by a refrigerator rather than a freezer and didn't realize my error until i had 6 frozen water bottles that night. i had recycled the box already and lugged it up to my second-floor bedroom. so there it dsits until i give it away/sell it. nice little freezer, though!",5,5

254667,42,i brought this cook top less than a month. there are rust spots on the burner that i cannot get out. i reach out to the manufactured who send someone who told me there is noting they can do about the rust spots. i had another brand for over 10 years and i never had rust spots. or any spot that i could not remove,5,5

676850,42,these are horrible. the bottoms of all of them tore once used so the grounds got into the coffee,5,5

43924,42,great filter. great price. the oem replacements are very expensive. easy install. save your money and go with these for the same filtration at a fraction of the cost.,5,5
339112,42,it's a good replacement. better and easier than trying to clean the old one.,5,5
643723,42,super reasonably priced. used to purchase these locally but they were over $20. 00. i will keep getting these online. so worth the wait in the mail.,5,5

347890,42,"very nice and stylish looking, the grills are very difficult to remove, had to remove front cover to access bulbs and to take grill filters out, instructions included are not clear at all for this model, the included 2 watt led bulbs were very dimm, i emailed support and they were courteous and promptly sent me brighter bulbs at no charge, over all it is a quality well made in the u s product, has a remote control which is kinda cool, i would have gave a 5 star if the filter design was better",4,5
149522,42,"installed this valve and my washer works again. however i am not sure if it's durable because the original valve, which is exactly the same part, failed in just two years.",5,5
644023,42,great price and value. very easy to install.,5,5
411697,42,the shipping was quick but the machine left a lot to be desired. the hoses it comes with aren't long enough and they don't fit any sort of faucet. the draining of the machine is the biggest problem besides filling it because it never has enough power to get all the water drained without laying the hose literally flat into a bucket and doing that several times which is the most annoying thing ever. the machine itself washing the stuff and has an decent space to fit things but the process of filling with a bucket and draining with a bucket is dumb.,1,5

383374,42,it was defective. we returned it for a refund and purchased a new dishwasher rather than go through the time and inconvenience of waiting to try to repair the dishwasher,5,5
189388,42,seems like an exact match for the door shell that i had to replace.,5,5
303277,42,did not fit as replacement for lt700p,5,1

667340,42,"i purchased this in hopes of finding a cheaper alternative to the actual ge version of this filter. sadly, based on my experience, you get what you pay for. the filter installed with ease, but the filtered water tasted worse than the water that comes out of my tap (which is heavily chlorinated chicago water). i gave it a couple of weeks to get better, but no luck. maybe i just got a dud. i ended up ordering the ge version in the end and the filtered water it produces is so much better. definitely sticking with that going forward.",1,1
352001,42,for whatever reason i thought save $40-$50 why not give it a shot. well that logic cost me $280. $130 for this one and then the $150 i spent on the oem i just bought. bought august 22. made it till october before it started to malfunction. by december it was as usable sitting on the counter in the picture as it was installed in freezer. iced up on fins that push ice out of trays. i would have to pry the ice out. shut it off. reset and leave off. come back reset and turn ice back on. it was almost like it got out of sync. new oem has been in for a few days with no issues yet. that makes it safe to say it was the ice maker rather than an issue with the freezer itself.,5,5
618633,42,i had been looking for a good reusable coffee filter for some time and found this one. i love that its easy to clean and way sturdier than a plastic filter i had!,5,5
5616,42,the air filter was the same fit and function as the oem filter. the carbon filter was a different texture but it seems to be doing the job. the cost was considerably cheaper than the oem brand,5,5
629462,42,cant see display even with brand new batteries. junk!,5,5
577455,42,easy to install- big upgrade for small cost.,5,5

533022,42,"i was all prepared to take half a day to install this shelf. nothing goes as shown on youtube. i was surprised when the new shelf went is as easily as shown in the installation videos. it took more time to open the box than it did to install. installation time was about 5 seconds. it fit perfectly and looks identical to the original. in the future, i'll attempt to not use it to close the refrigerator door.",5,5
595033,42,"love them! smaller than the old knobs, but popped on no problem, and loook so much better that the original!",5,5
245653,42,easy install but we tested the water before and after and the water tested the same! . shouldn't the water be filtered to test cleaner?,5,5

49862,42,this was awesome to clean out the dryer vent. i feel much better i used this to clean out the dryer vent.,5,5
347888,42,an acceptable replacement for a poorly made oem handle. plastic is too soft and you can easily strip the screw holes or even break the plastic off surrounding the screw holes if you over tighten the screws. i broke one of the holes on the new handle and had to drill it down deeper and use a longer screw to fix the problem. ge could have used a more durable plastic. i probably would not buy ge kitchen products again.,3,5
666919,42,i had no clue how dirty old filter was until i put this new one on! i could hear that the fan wasn't struggling nearly as much to pull air through.,5,5

96556,42,i have examined this product and it seems to be up to standards i have not had the opportunity to put it to use yet but i am sure that it will serve its purpose.,5,5
112689,42,"this is a handsome little beverage ice maker that does a fine job of making small batches of ice quickly. it fits in well with all our other stainless steel appliances, and sits on the wet bar nicely, without taking up too much room. i almost took off a star because the otherwise handy plastic ice scoop that comes with it has no good resting place. we improvised and drilled a small hole in the handle, placing a magnetic hook on the side of the machine, where the scoop now hangs. it's a nice workaround, but probably should have been included with the unit. i don't see much use for the small or medium ice settings, as those ice bullets are quite small, and easily melt away, due to the nature of the shape and temperature of this ice. but, the large bullets work really well for beverages. i would not recommend this ice maker for applications where you need hard, crystallized ice, such as icing down an injury. you'll want harder, more substantial ice for that. but, for drinks, and at the reasonable sales price, this thing is just what the doctor ordered!",5,5
112646,42,got exactly what i ordered and matched perfectly.,5,5
262095,42,"it's very clever and simple. 1) use finger lever to hold open while scooping up coffee. 2) use finger lever to hold closed while pouring coffee out the funnel. it couldn't be easier. and, the scoop measures 2 tablespoons, which is the industry standard recommended amount per cup.",5,5
64222,42,"i purchased this thinking it was stainless steel because of the shine in the pictures and also the fact that the description says material type-stainless steel. this is an ugly, non-shiny flat gray machine with absolutely no gleam or shine at all. maybe that’s why they are offering a $20 of coupon. because they are liars. 😏",5,5
638294,42,the correct piece. but if your washing machine door randomly pops open and enterupts the cycle. this is not the piece that needs replacing. save your money. our kitchen aid has a door issue. we replaced the latch and the catch and the springs. no workie. we suspect it is a née issue. not sure how much money we are going to throw at it. we have rigged it to stay closed by wedging a hard plastic children's cup between the panel and the base of the machine to wedge it closed. it's a pain but it works and it does not make a tripping hazard or an eye sore like bungee cords or mop handle.,5,1
45741,42,great product for the price very thin but it gets the job done. i will deaf order again if i run out!,5,5
117209,42,"the sticker was darker than pictured. to make it smaller it appeared to be squished instead of cropped or reduced in aspect. therefore i am not happy. someone else might not care, but personally i don't prefer a dark squished down dolphin.",5,1

157290,42,"pricey but worth it for the ""value-addedness"" of being able to store more stuff better in our fridge. while there appeared to be ""universal"" options available, there were also people disappointed that those didn't fit properly. i have ordered this item from this seller 3 times now (so much for the great savings buying the frig second hand! ) and each time has been quick delivery, product as described and expected.",5,5

113150,42,this is a filter that i will buy again.,5,5
449608,42,worked perfectly as a replacement for my microwave oven tray.,5,5
609623,42,"a couple of things. one, the foil must be folded under the cup which makes it hard to remove. two, it doesn’t always work. i have had pods not produce any coffee with these foils. i’m returning them and re-ordering rhe capmesso foils. they don’t overlap and work every time.",1,5
651329,42,"we have a 8 month old fridge that came with no extra filters. we purchased these to replace ours. it was not easy to get out or put in the new one but may just be our fixture. so far after following directions, water is clear and tastes great. we like the chemicals this filters and feel good with the purchase. will up date when we have had it longer.",5,5
526699,42,"perfect fix for our washer. i'm sure we'll have to buy new ones in several years. the way the washer is designed, they just aren't meant to last forever. it was a tight fit switching them out, but our washer works like new again. thank you!",5,5
367345,42,this knob was made sturdier than the old one. like they knew the old ones had an issue and they fixed it. easy to replace.,5,5

386184,42,"this was a perfect fit for my maytag dishwasher latch that broke and had to be replaced. had to remove inner door panel to change out handle, and the hardest part was getting the electrical leads off the old handle posts. had to force them off with pliers. rated it a 4, not because of fit or service, but because this part is almost all plastic, and seems flimsy, just like the original.",5,5
569343,42,"it's cloud based. but the server is constantly down, rendering the product useless.",5,1
27520,42,"a satisfactory single-burner hot plate. this worked for about 3. 5 years, then died. for the time when it worked, it was a perfectly reasonable option for cooking small items and worked fine. for the price, probably a reasonable option, even if it doesn't last super long.",5,5
213365,42,i have been using the cones for many years; thought this might be a good alternative since it doesn't need a separate filter. i'd rather use the cones and the filteea.,4,5

94293,42,[[videoid:a5df307159b17b5074a9aa5141872f71]] very impressed with the ice making rate and quality! i really like the option to adjust how fast each sleeve of ice is produced and the hardness. in 8 minutes this thing is dropping enough ice for a full glass of ice. i use it for my coolers regularly and an hour later there is plenty of ice. i also like the blue light. kind of cool!,5,5
442068,42,"they are a great price, arrived quickly and work as advertised! i will order again!",5,5

445008,42,when i first encountered the agitator slipping i feared an expensive repair. i was an am greatly relieved this inexpensive was the solution. at this price one repair is great but i have enough for several repairs on hand. definitely a win.,5,5

356143,42,we used it to filter the water in our keurig coffee maker.,1,5
329159,42,bought these to monitor temperature and humidity in our house and crawl space. seem to be fairly accurate readings on them.,5,5
412923,42,so far so good = the filter fit & seems to be doing the job i bought it to do,5,5
195815,42,had a hard time get it in but once done and in works great,5,5

117621,42,"this product uses a transformer for power. shortly after the return period ended the transformer did not work, the seller is unable to provide a replacement. total waste of $$",1,1
654613,42,they did the trick. exactly what i needed.,5,5
238830,42,"good communication with blue stars but didn’t fix the problem. also, had to cut a bit of metal off to get to replace existing one. was told it was an exact replacement ( by amazon) but it wasn’t. could be just different years of this washer had different thermostats. anyway, good customer service but still looking to fix the “always on” heat to the dryer.",5,5
424824,42,very good basket. saves paper coffee filters and makes decent coffee. the only thing is that it is hard not to wash some leftover coffee grounds down the drain if you would rather put it in the compost.,5,5
335058,42,you can only use one two or three times and then it breaks.,1,5
583454,42,we ordered this 2 years ago and we needed a new one and it arrived it wasn't the right size. the2 connector points were closer together making it difficult to slot into the holes at the back of the oven and the bracket at the bottom of the oven does not line up anymore because of the distance of the bracket to attach to the back of the oven is in a different location. very disappointing.,5,5
202057,42,this filter is a direct drop in replacement. you get two filters for about half the price of a single filter you would buy at home depot or lowes.,5,5
508081,42,"i actually used these on my kenmore dishwasher, you know, since whirlpool makes every dishwasher in the universe they were the exact same part that the kenmore uses.",5,5
391968,42,exactly the part i needed. after watching video took less than 10 minutes to replace.,5,5
625552,42,a lot less expensive than the filters from keurig. seem to work well despite some bad reviews by others. no trouble installing them.,5,5
289405,42,"these work as well as any other screens i've used. in that respect, they are mostly the same. something i do like is that these have a little ferrule on the inside of the screen. i doubt it is strictly necessary, i have never had one start to fray from there, but it's a nice touch.",5,5
156575,42,you need to find a video on youtube to see how this is installed. you must take the entire ice bin apart including the ice crusher part to install this. i took a picture on my smart phone of the rod/spring unit on the bottom of the ice bucket so i would know how to put it back together. i am glad i did. take your time. be sure to find the video and view it a couple times to understand how this works. you must remove lots of screws etc. to actually get to where you replace this drum. replacing the drum is easy. getting to it isn't so easy. and then you have to put it all back. i didn't have any problems but you should be handy to attempt this. why only four stars? it is over priced but you have to pay what you have to pay.,5,5
554632,42,love this product. easy to install and adds room to your refrigerator,5,5
365754,42,"i got 16 pairs of filters for about $5, so i don't think there is a better deal on the market - if you're trying to save money, these are definitely the filters to get. the filters arrived in a plastic bag inside a bubble mailer, so things got a little smushed, presumably in transit. each filter i looked at didn't exactly match the size of the oem filter i had. however, with a little more nudging than required with oems, these will fit. the quality doesn't appear to be as good as the oems either. the reason i opted for this purchase is because my oem filter looked like it needed to be changed well in advance of the schedule in the manual. while our bin doesn't get full, (could probably run everyday for a week and not need to dump it), the filter does seem to pick up quite a bit. the black sponge bit and pre-filter can be washed, but the white, papery filter needs to be replaced and our seems to get dirty enough to warrant changing once a month or so. i bought these filters so that i can change them more frequently. overall recommend at the price point, but if the price goes up, i probably would look elsewhere.",5,5
562575,42,"this product is as described, easy not hard to install, does run with some noise yet after the bin is full it is quieter. after first filling, the bin filled faster. i believe that we will enjoy the convenience of not always having to buy ice when our whole family is together. in use about 3 months",5,5

487419,42,"i received my bellemain frothing pitcher (12 oz) this evening and could not wait to try it. i was very pleased with the simplicity of the design and apparent quality of the pitcher, and was even happier when i made my first butterfly pea flower latte! i use plant and nut milks, my favorite for lattes being oat milk. within seconds, the pitcher was filled with perfectly frothed oat milk; i prefer thick froth, and this pitcher did not disappoint! pouring was smooth and precise with no drips at all. i waivered between a 12 oz and 20 oz, but decided the 12 oz should be fine, and it was. because the volume of liquid increases as air is whipped into it, it makes plenty for one to two mugs, depending on mug size and how you make your beverage. i heat about 1/4 c of water to steep the butterfly pea flowers in, then fill a mug about 1/3 full with oat milk and heat. i add the butterfly pea flower tea to the heated milk and then poured in the frothed milk (i filled the frothing pitcher about 1/3 of the way with cold, full fat oat milk (fav brand is oatly) and added a little califia almond/coconut milk vanilla creamer. it frothed up beautifully in no time at all). my mug was filled to the brim - hands down the best latte i have had - what a difference frothing the milk makes! the pitcher was easy to clean and is so pretty in its simplicity and craftsmanship that i am leaving it out on display - plus i’ll be using it everyday anyway. it can also be used to serve creamers as it looks lovely on the table.",5,5

281900,42,"sweet, work great, fitted right in.",5,5
274292,42,"i cross threaded the plastic part while putting back up the hose on my kenmore he4t. unfortunately it wasn't fixable. so i ordered this part form amazon and the only difference is the color of the water hose attachment (grey versus blue, who cares? ). it fitted perfectly and the screw hole matched with no problems. the part had on the box certified whirlpool so i'm assuming it is oem. after the repair i did a laundry and checked for leaks, everything was good so i guess it will be just fine. my washer is 10 years old but still working properly so it was worth it to change this part for cheap and install it myself. you have good reviews in here on how to do it with pictures and step so if you are in trouble, that would help you. i put a dab of silicone grease on the threads in order to help for sealing but also to ease the process of screwing in the hose as metal on plastic may be a bit rough. next time i'll know better but this is how you learn. thanks to amazon for providing next day shipping.",5,5

395746,42,arrived in a very timely manner. easy to install and good quality parts.,5,5
248279,42,"the screws provided were useless. they had a flat end (like a bolt) instead of a pointed end like a regular screw. this made it impossible to break through the plastic housing to attach the covers. luckily, i had the correct screws on hand. also, the rack adjustment feature feels flimsy and i'm noticing that one side tends to slip down easily. i needed you tube videos to do the job since the instructions (blurry photos) were pathetic. got the job done but not impressed.",5,4
266204,42,"this is a high quality product. expensive though. but it’s better to spend a bit more for a quality product to keep your refrigerator working properly. it’s a lot more expensive to have to replace the entire refrigerator. it is important to read the instructions and flush the filter before using. once flushed, the water is smooth and tasteless - as fresh water should be.",5,5
466004,42,i couldn't get it to fit any of my faucets. can't send it back because i cut the end off [trying to get it to work that way] nothing worked. it was a waste of money for me. i bought it for my portable washing machine. here's the funny side of it. i never needed it. the machine works without the extension. lol!,1,1
499128,42,fits very well in my 10 cup bunn. these filter very well.,5,5
14334,42,"i got this for my tiny apartment because i truly hate hand washing dishes. i intended to put it on the counter next to the sink. but it sits under a cabinet and without the faucet adapter, i had to stand there longer than i wanted to slowly pour water into the top intake. it only held 4 8"" plates, 1 small pasta strainer, 3 8oz glasses and a handful of silverware. at the end of the 40 minutes quick cycle, i had a few clean dishes, that i could have hand washed much faster. the temp gage on the front indicated the water never got over 120 degrees f. so, not hot to sanitize the dishes. i'll try it out a few more times, but i am not sure this tiny thing is worth all the effort. *update* the coupler the product page recommends you use, does not fit the intake hose. i got an adaptor to make the first adaptor fit and it still didn't fill the tank up because the interior diameter of the hose that comes with the washer is narrower than a pencil. the fill hose is worthless. i'll have to pull the machine out from under the cabinet and fill it by hand forever. the 'glass' cycle' is a joke. it goes through an hour long cycle, then just sits motionless for the remaining 40 minutes of the cycle.",5,5

103238,42,"the bottom is all plastic with a fairly high lip. the other filters that i have bought had mesh all the way with plastic cross bars for stability. this plastic bottom causes not all the coffee to drip through. what rises past this lip is a very diluted coffee. you can easily test this by ""brewing"" just water. you will see water stagnate at the bottom of the filter.",5,5
