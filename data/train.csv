257157,42,"This portable washer is so convenient if you live in a small apartment with no laundry on site. I definitely recommend it. The only recommendation I have is do not use too much soap because then you will have to use a lot of water to get all the soap out. Other than that it does a great job in spinning the clothes dry, I also bought The drying rack to help finish the drying process. It doesn’t make too much noise and it’s super lightweight. I haven’t stopped using it since it arrived. Also, make sure you drain the water properly after using.",5

121245,42,"I used these brackets to secure an older (Frigidaire) dishwasher to my kitchen cabinets after installing granite countertops. The Frigidaire dishwasher was an older model and as such was not fitted or designed in any way to be used with side mounting. The dishwasher had brackets welded to the top of an aluminum band which held the plastic dishwasher body to the metal dishwasher door frame. But I couldn't use these brackets since you cannot screw into granite without possible damaging it.  However, even the aluminum band went around the dishwasher exterior.  There was absolutely no where to ""hook"" a bracket (you also could not screw into the aluminum band because you might puncture the plastic dishwasher body which would cause leaks and trash your dishwasher). So I purchased these brackets and J-B Weld 8265S Original Cold-Weld Steel Reinforced Epoxy - 2 oz. I mixed the epoxy and put a healthy amount on that aluminum band which I described above. I then stuck these brackets in that epoxy and used blue painter's tape to hold the brackets in place. I let the epoxy fully cure (15-24 hours) and then I tested. SOLID HOLD. Just like a a steel weld. I pushed the dishwasher back in the cabinet and used 1/2 inch wood screws to secure to base cabinet frame. The other side was next to a sheetrocked wall so I used 4 inch screws and found a stud close-by and screwed the bracket directly into a stud.  Mounting now is solid as a rock. Dishwasher does not move at all. Hope this helps. Good luck!",5

395751,42,"Great for apartments, I have a family of six. We just used it for the first time as a large load. It worked great! The wash cycle is perfect for separated garments.<br /><br />Recommendation for this product:<br />Pros:<br />1) cleans well.<br />2)Use smaller loads. And will clean two pairs of adult jeans on wash side, and spin dry one pair at a time on the spin dry side.<br />3) it is small to a point and light to carry or lift when empty.<br />4) Great for apartment use, and no bigger than six people per washer! If you have more than six people per week that you have to wash for I would recommend getting two of these.<br />5) works great if placed in the bathroom shower tub; make sure that you use proper electrical safety guidelines. Also maybe you should use a showerhead that is extended, or the inlet tube.<br />6) for a family of six; I spent 3 1/2 hours washing and spin drying six people‘s clothes. About 15 to 20 minutes on wash, and 5 to 10 minutes depending on items placed in spin dryer for each load.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The cord of this item is very short you will need an extension cord. Remember to use proper safety electrical guidelines if you place it anywhere near a tub or water source.<br />2) if the spin dryer is alone while working, it will shake the entire product. And could damage the machine if not properly secured.<br />3) The drain hose is very short, if you do not have your product elevated on a stand and secured above the drain area, the pump will only get 95% of the water out and leave some in the hose which can cause mold or mildew to fester if left undrained.<br />4) this may or may not be a con however, the inlet hose that it comes with does not secure very well to the Fossett or showerhead connection, so be aware of this.<br />5) The noise level is fine, however it would be nice if the machine came with a buzzer or a bell to tell you when it is finished. So you have to be listening for the machine to stop, or be watching it or set a timer for yourself. Or you will forget about it.<br /><br />All in all, this product is extremely worth the money that I spent. I will recommend this product to everyone I know.

256333,42,"Like many, I bought this because I live in an apartment with no washer or dryer. Overall, I like it for what it is. However, potential buyers need to keep in mind that they aren't purchasing a fancy washer/dryer- this really can't take the place of a proper set up. For perspective, I use this to wash items that cant wait for me to get to the laundromat and baby clothes.<br /><br />Here are some things to keep in mind with this item, and honestly others like it (as I don't think it's a brand/quality issue so much as a limitation of this product in general type scenario):<br /><br />1. To drain the water after rinsing, the hose uses gravity. This means the drain needs at the base or below the washing machine to work. Don't attempt to pick this machine up while full of water. To deal with this, I put this machine in my bathtub while in use.<br /><br />2. These aren't sturdy items. It is best to have it on the ground rather than on some sort of cart to drain into a sink, if you're thinking of trying that. They also become unbalanced quite easily.<br /><br />3. The user cannot do a large load or put heavy items in the washer. I can probably fit 1 pair of denim pants in the rinse portion, but they will not fit in the spin cycle, at least not without the washer trying  rocket itself off to space. Best to skip the spin cycle for heavier garments all together and just hang dry.<br /><br />4. The spin cycle gets off balance easily. Make sure to evenly lay out clothes in the drum to get the best results. Also, you will need multiple spin cycles to get through all the clothes in the rinse cycle, as it is much smaller.<br /><br />5. Be prepared to use a LOT of water. You will need to use multiple rinses to get all the soap out. This take some trial and error to get the right balance. Also, side note, much easier to fill the rinse basin using the shower head than the provided tube.<br /><br />6. Lint! Invest in a lint roller. Or several. Once your clothes are dry they will need a good rub down with one of these.",4

592964,42,"I had been wanting this type of cooktop for about a year before I got it.  To me the worst part about cooking  is cleaning the stove. Even a regular glass cooktop could be hard if you dropped something on the burner and it baked on or under the knobs.  This induction cooktop is a breeze and I will never go back. The only thing that I was surprised about is that the top does get warm, but it won't burn you. I thought it didn't get hot or even warm, but I can live with warm.  Nothing get baked on on though.",5

49993,42,"I just received this machine today, less than 48 hours after ordering it, which I was ecstatic about! Delivery was supposed to take 7-10 days even through Amazon as this wasn’t a Prime product. I’m VERY impressed with delivery! Machine itself is a bit smaller than expected but I think it will suit my needs. I’ll give my final product review in a few days. Well packaged! Update: Pros: Very good at getting clothes cleaned, better than expected! Was able to get more clothes in it than anticipated. Spin dry is excellent just don’t overload it. Was able to use a tad of softener & a very minimal (1/5 tsp of Downy Unstoppables). Cons: You need to reload (refill) clean water after washing to completely rinse clothes adequately (used gentle cycle for this). No instructions on how much water needs to be added to spin cycle. Came with no lint trap but I used disinfectant wipes after each use which basically caught any lint or fuzzies. Can tangle clothes if you do not put enough water in it (rinsing) - learning curve using it. Overall I’m very happy with this purchase! I wish now I’d purchased the biggest unit they offer. Advise: Put in shower & use handheld shower nozzle to insert water into machine which allows water to drain into shower drain. Since this is a gravity drain unit, I used 5” tall sturdy chair risers (4” wide - Amazon) and placed unit on these which worked out great both in draining & maintaining condition of unit.",5

I have stuffed blankets in there and still no drying issues.<br />I also bought the smaller 2.x sq feet model for a rental and also no complaints.<br />It would be nice if there was a lint trap rather than having to clean the door seal, but its not that big of a deal.<br />If you are short on space, no 220v line for a dryer, no exhaust to outside, or no hot water line, these machines are especially what you need.<br />Even if you have all the conventional hookups, I'd still recommend it. it also seems they clean much better than my LG top loader (that I also put in another rental unit). There are some video's online that explain how to open the machine up (I guess after several years of usage) to clean out lint from the lint duct and condensing area.

The only issue I had with this product was that the magnet to one side has come off because my dog got to it, it still works though because there’s magnets on both sides and you only need the magnet on one side to keep the door propped open.

On top of that, the overall construction of the burner is on the light side (nice for backpacking I guess...but I was concerned about durability). This burner is made in China (unlike the Solo Stove flagship products) and, candidly, just seemed cheaply built. I returned the broken unit to Amazon and purchased a Trangia burner as a replacement. The Trangia burner is everything I'd wished the Solo-branded burner would have been. It's built of heavier brass, solid, starts and &#34;blooms&#34; quickly and easily, and the simmer ring works as expected.

Because of the thickness of the silicone, it seemed a bit more difficult to get the fill level right on the capsule.<br /><br />Now for the tip...One thing I found that isn't mentioned is that the green funnel also makes for a handy tool to seal the foil lid. Just put the capsule in the black holder, the foil sits right on top and fits perfectly within the ""outer"" ring of the black holder, then press down with the green funnel and twist back and forth a bit while pushing down. UPDATE: I found that while this works, a quick press around the edge with the brush handle gets a much better seal - so my revised process is a quick press and turn of the green part keeps the foil in place and then a quick press with the brush handle to finish. Doing it this way, the process of filling a capsule only took about 30 seconds from grinding to popping it in the machine.<br /><br />Being able to use paper filters is also nice to filter out cafestol (elevates cholesterol) if that's a concern for heavy coffee drinkers.",5

307067,42,"I bought my chemex after seeing it in a local coffee shop, and trying the delicious coffee it made.  I thought it was such a cool yet simple coffee maker, and the final product was quite good.  I bought the chemex and the special chemex filter, as the person at the coffee shop told me they were special filters specifically for the chemex maker (a bit more expensive than standard ones).<br /><br />Anyways upong bringing my chemex coffee maker home, I was immediately hooked.  I don't know what does it, but for some reason the coffee from my chemex changed the way I enjoyed my coffee, and makes an INCREDIBLE cup of coffee.  Before I was using a single cup plastic melitta pour over and a french press...the chemex blew them both out of the water.<br /><br />I think it's partially due to the full glass beaker design, which does not impart any impurities in the coffee that plastic potentially could.  And I also think it's partially due to the filters, which is why I'm writing this review!  The filters are extra think bonded filters, that seems to contain every single grain of sediment without sacrificing the delicious oils and aromas from the coffee beans.  It allows for the perfect flow of coffee through the beans as well, slow enough so the coffee seeps long enough (like a french press, without the grinds in the cup).<br /><br />I do recommend wetting the filter first before putting the grinds in.  I think it washed out any filter flavor a bit (maybe placebo), and it also may help with the flow of the coffee.  Also, not related to the quality of the filters at all, but I HIGHLY recommend you grind your whole coffee beans right before use...it makes a world of difference in the quality and freshness of your coffee.  Ideally a burr grinder, but at least a spice grinder is better than nothing.",5

69259,42,"I've had many different driers over the years, and they've all dried clothes. The only differences were capacity, heat source, and features. It didn't matter the capacity, the heat source (gas or electric), or the features, they all had one thing in common, they dried your clothes. The permanent press cycles are nice, the cool down cycles are nice, infinite temperature settings are nice, but they are all worthless if it doesn't ultimately dry your clothes in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Then there's this drier. It is the absolute worst drier I have ever used. It will not dry a load of clothes on one dry cycle. Doesn't matter how many clothes are in the drier, how long the cycle is, the temperature of the cycle, items never come out dry. And I don't mean a little dampness or slight cool-to-the-touch around the waist line, I mean wet.  It always takes at least 2 cycles, and often more, to get them dry. Especially towels.  I will be up half the night restarting the drier every 75 minutes or so just to get one load dry!  It must have 15 different drying cycle types, and it doesn't matter which one you use, everything is still is wet on completion.<br /><br />This is the only computerized drier I've ever purchased, and it will be the last.

59876,42,"I bought this at Target last spring and while it wasn't the most perfect product, I was pretty excited about having it.  When people complain about the taste, that's either them not rinsing out the machine initially (which I did) or just using water that isn't the best quality.  I washed mine well a few times with hot soapy water and used water from my Brita water pitcher that I keep in the fridge.  It suggests wasting the first few batches which I did.  The ice tasted fine.<br /><br />The ice is a very soft ice which is great for just eating alone.  My kids loved it.  They would just want a cup of ice. Pretty funny.  But because the ice is very soft, it melts very quickly, especially in room temp drinks.  But if you use a lot of it, you can get by with not being too bothered by that. It will make a batch about every 12 minutes which was nice.<br /><br />As a side note, the ice melts while sitting in the unit, it is not cooled in any way. It's just like a cooler sitting in your kitchen.  The warmer your house is, the faster it melts.<br /><br />The machine is noisy while making ice (it's wasn't as bad as others state though, but then again I'm used to a noisy house with 3 kids. lol.), which I did not mind, but the machine also makes other noises that are not normal...but only after months of having it.  There was enough water, but it sounded like the pump was on it's way out.  I would unplug it for a few days then plug it back in and usually it was better.  Not always though. My husband would tease, it's on it's way out!  I knew it was close.  Not even a year old.<br /><br />A few months ago, it just stopped freezing the ice cubes.  The machine goes through the motions of making ice, but doesn't actually freeze anything.  What a bummer. So, a year old and now just a worthless piece of junk for $109.00 (luckily it was on sale at Target).  I originally justified the $ by thinking I would use it at parties and for the ice chests on outings, but no you can't.  It just melts too fast and there isn't enough for a party.  I still ended up buying bags of ice for those occasions. Maybe if you bag up this ice then store it in the freezer???<br /><br />It was an alright machine while it lasted.  It did light up often that there was too much ice when there really wasn't or the right side where the metal sensor was had a few pieces barely touching it and then the left side of the basket was pretty empty.  As others reviewers states though, just knock the ice down so it's evened out and then hold onto the metal sensor for about 20 seconds then it re-triggers it to start making ice again.<br /><br />The machine is a descent size too. It was difficult to maneuver it around to clean it out. I won't miss dealing with that. I would clean it out every week.  Something else I just remembered.  After about 6 months of running it....all the stickly labels (the warning labels) got moldy (black) on the underside of the lid (cover). I thought how stupid to put something paper in an area with direct moisture contact.  Gross.  I scraped it all off with a razor blade and cleaned it really good.  It would be better to take those off first or they should be covered with contact paper or something. What a dumb idea on Emerson's part.<br /><br />So, if you are willing to spend the $ for ice for one year, then go for it, but if you expect a machine of that cost to last longer, then look for another one.  I wish the ""good"" reviews stated how long they had owned it.  Over the year, my machine was probably turned on and making ice about 80% of the time.  I have noticed other machines that look identical to this with different names. I can't help but wonder if they are selling the same crappy machine with new names now. Just do your research.",1

648189,42,"Very powerful!  You can see a ""tornado"" effect with the smoke and steam that gets sucked into it. Solid and heavy!  It comes with a flexible vent tube.  Great venting to my outside.  Very little smell and the fire alarms are not going off anymore!  I am a pro chef and I need this power to handle my home high heat cooking!  Beware that it really takes three people to install this hood.  It is VERY difficult to hold a hood, position it right and secure it to the wall correctly without three.  I did it with my 15 year old and it wasn't pretty, but we did it.  I recommend 3!  I replaced a microwave/hood combo and it is like night and day.  The remote is handy at my kitchen table and responds well.  When it is on high it is like a commercial hood, and you can hear it, no doubt.  But that is what I need.  Low fan is somewhat quieter.  I would recommend this hood to any home application.",5

Just check your model for fit first.<br />This was VERY tough to slide onto the motor shaft, but once it's on, it's a great fit.<br />Word of advice: If you're replacing one of these because of broken fins, or because of a noisy / vibrating evap fan in your fridge, you MORE THAN LIKELY need to replace the rubber grommets from above / below the evap motor as well. Check for those, save yourself some trouble and go ahead and replace them at the same time. If your fan got noisy it's probably because the grommets got torn and worn first, and so you need to replace those too - at least, if you don't want to do this same repair in a couple more months :)",5

Wow!  I was quite impressed at the quality and appearance of these rings and pans!  I wholeheartedly give them &#34;two thumbs up!&#34; and plan on keeping this company and the part numbers info on hand.  I also got really FAST shipping (2 days!) with Amazon Prime membership.",5

42102,42,"fantastic product. I just installed my new one on may 19 2017. Works great. it takes away all the smell from the kitchen.  We do make lots of spicy food and it worked great for us. I installed it with a height of 30inches from cook top and under a cabinet. It needs a 6inch vent. Installation is very easy. I replaced an over the range microwave (36 inches, 450 cfm)  with this 36inch 900cfm hood. We do a lot of cooking at home with oil and spices. The physical appearance of the product looks very sturdy and strong. The steel used is very thick and heavy. So no bending and denting issues. Easy to clean.<br />One problem I faced during installation is the screw holes provided to hang the hood on the wall is right behind the control box. it is very difficult to make a standard screwdriver to reach there. If they could increase the height of the steel plate they attached behind the control box for screw placement, it will make it very easy.<br />Over all it is a very good product. I recommend this to everyone.",5

Clamp's seem to have decent quality because as i was torquing the bolt pretty tight (mind you a lot of water pressure comes through this piece of rubber) it did not jump the clamp threads like can happen on some hose clamps. My model whirlpool was the Gold series, and my part number was w10195114 which essentially has almost no purchasing options or lookup cross references, but this looks, feels and fits like a direct replacement.

I'm using a 2nd temp sensor in garage simutaneously so I can monitor temperature difference. I want the plant to spend as many nights around 40 degrees as possible. The Hub package w/2 temp sensors is extremely affordable compared to other brands that charge $99 alone for their  Hub. The YoLink Hub accommodates 300 YoLink device connections.

320399,42,"This is perfect! This hose is very thick rubber. Bends great and again its thick. 1st thing, throw the hose clamp in the garbage. Do not use it. Its cheap and very thin. You wont get enough bite on the threads before it strips. I buy ""pro line"" hose clamps here on amazon for whatever size I need. They are decent quality. I didnt remove any panels for access. I tilted the washer back and shoved a step stool under it. There will be water in the old hose so have fun when you pull it off. All you need is decent scissors to cut the new hose. Make sure you cut the hose to the right size ""diameter"" of  the drain tube you are putting this hose on. I used the old mounting tabs that held the previous hose in place. You dont want the hose flopping around. Also, I only needed 6 foot. I didnt want the full 12ft hanging around with water in it. So the end that connects to the wall drain I cut it as well. Again scissors. Leave yourelf some extra hose so you can pull the washer out later. There is a piece this package gives you to attach to the end after cutting it. This is a VERY simple fix that takes 10-15min tops. When you're under the washer, look around for any other leaks or damage etc. Check your water supply hoses in back and see if there is any damage or sand/crud in them. They normally have screens in them. Now, get back to washing and hope thats all that was leaking!",5

206816,42,"I installed these 4 wheels on my Kenmore dryer. The dryer is a 1989 vintage dryer. Old in other words. These 4 wheels fit perfectly with no modification. They was no sloppy looseness on the shafts after installation. Most importantly they fixed the problem with noise.<br /><br />The wheels are not red as the photo. Aside from that they look exactly like the ones I removed. The original ones have never been replaced until  now. I bought this dryer new in 1989. I hope these last half that long. The clips worked and there were 2 for each wheel. The dryer has been in operation since these were installed and used 4 to 6 times a week. No noises.<br /><br />I replaced the belt at the same time. I also removed the idler and lubed it. I have read concerns about lubing these wheels. I do not think using a layer of grease on the shafts will cause any problems. The dust that does get behind the drum will only stick to the external area near the wheels. I do not see how this can be a problem. Remember, the original had a layer of lube and they lasted until December 2014. I believe that's about 26 years. (the dryer was built in 1988)<br /><br />If you need wheels and these fit your dryer, I would recommend a purchase. I have no connection with this or any company involved with this product. It is my opinion only. Thanks.",5

There is no compasison to all the other washers and dryers built outside the USA and what we thought were USA made machines but were not.<br />Speed Queen really is the best and USA made.

When I got home I bought and tried 9 different phin filters trying to recreate the authentic Vietnamese brew complexity.  None of the others matched the quality and style of this one.<br />Key points - it is aluminum so it stays hot (stainless steel gets cold immediately and it affects how the brew turns out).  Also, the plunger has little notches that fit under little bumps in the chamber to keep it from tilting up while brewing.  And it's beautiful to look at, a sweet reminder of Vietnamese style and culture.",5
19432,42,"This was advertised as OEM which leads you to believe it is up to the original manufacturer's standards.  That may be a misunderstanding on my part.  Either way, the quality is not quite up to that of the original part being replaced, but it serves its purpose.  It is just a tad smaller than the original and doesn't fit quite as snug, so it doesn't trap the lint quite as well as the original. The wire mesh is very thin and will probably not last long, which was why I eventually had to replace the original, due to a large hole that formed and the duct tape was just not quite working.  The original, however, was 15 years old.  I don't foresee this one lasting near that long, but then again, I doubt the dryer will either:)",3

284692,42,"Delivered early on day of delivery after Amazon delayed shipment by one week due to over orders. The delivery people carried it inside where I needed it which was much appreciated. I removed it from box to check for damage while the delivery people were here, didn't see any. The whole refrigerator comes she used in a very thin clear plastic material like shrink wrap. It was very difficult to remove and took me perhaps half an hour to get all of it off. When I did I found a big scratch on the side of the door which I had not seen before. At this point returning it would've been extremely difficult to have to repackage and go through all the hassle of unpackaging a replacement so I called Amazon customer service and they were very considerately and without hassle gave me a large refund. Kudos to Amazon for this.<br />The instruction manual is a joke containing almost 0 useful information. I needed this because I couldn't level the refrigerator and with some inspection found that there are no leveling feet at the back. This means if you're trying to level it in two directions, front to back and side to side it can't be done. I had to make props for the rear rollers to get it level in my house. I also called the number for Frigidaire about this issue and I got some woman who knew nothing about it with roosters crowing in the background. She said she would have the tech team call me but they never did. At that point I had created my own solutions so it was unnecessary.<br />The refrigerator itself is attractive, quiet and useful. You cannot open the doors without moving the whole refrigerator until you have enough food and liquids in it to hold it in place. But I suppose that is true with all small refrigerators. The bottom produce drawer is funky and the way it moves, it has no guides. Otherwise I'm pleased with the purchase, the price, the delivery people, and Amazon Customer Service.

448827,42,I chose this model & brand based on other reviews - and it hasn't disappointed. I have two of them and they are working fine. The adjustable shelves are easy to move around and I'm happy this mini fridge doesn't have one of those itty bitty freezers.,5

51715,42,"Great,  Awesome,  what other wonderful things can I say.  Yes it is noisy in quiet kitchen,  and it puts out a little heat,  but for our second home where the water is less than great and we used to buy bagged ice it is wonderful.  Perfect amount of ice for two to four people,  Easy to clean and drain when we leave,  Have ice within 1 hour of set up.  No complaints here",5

Reason being? no locking mechanism between each joint like quality products, don't buy this like me, don't get this thing stuck someplace when backing it out because the geniuses that made this product did not implement a way to lock the pieces together so they just come apart..<br /><br />Looks great, but it's horrid..

274853,42,Exactly what I needed and came in the expected time frame.,5
652994,42,We bought this for our camper and it is great and does not take up a lot of room. Ice bin or tray is fairly small but if you have an area to put it in after it fills up you will be good to go if not just expect a two to three people to use without being able to put ice in freezer when full If you’re like me and when you can’t return to refill your adult beverage constantly,5

443674,42,"Nice easy to look at package. Does not take up a lot of space. Produces great tasting ice if you use bottled water as I do.<br />So what's not to like?<br />This machine like most others does not store the ice. The ice drops into an unrefrigerated space.<br />So you have to dump the ice into your freezer but it's wet ice and clumps up into really nasty big clumps.<br />Yeah, you can have 24 pounds in 24 hours if you constantly service the machine by emptying the ice and filling the small water reservoir.<br />Yes, the price is right, the looks are fine but of course there are some serious drawbacks.",3
92782,42,I am not a repair woman but I can follow instructions. I watched a few YouTube videos (what did we do before YouTube?) and was able to install it pretty quickly. The next morning I had ice!

60399,42,Very happy with product. I keep several filled so I do not have to empty and fill for each cup of coffee.,5
602105,42,What the picture is. Is not what we received. We received a 6 in x 4 in gray accordian filter not a 3x3 or something close to that enclosed in a white case. We couldn’t figure out where the huge thing went finally my husband cut it down to the tiny priece and stuck it in the slot,1
646635,42,"Amazing!! I have a Samsung RS265TDRS refrigerator. As soon as the Samsung filter (that the fridge came with) needed to be replaced I bought the Water Sentinel brand. It's generic, so the price attracted me...what can I say, I'm a cheapskate! :) As 2 years went by, my husband and I became increasingly frustrated with our fridge. The water pressure on the door was pathetic to say the least. We had running jokes about the time it took to fill a simple glass of water. This time I looked at buying the Samsung filter not even thinking it would improve my water pressure issue. I did because I found out that the Water Sentinel brand actually filters out less particles compared to the Samsung filter. Well I paid the extra cash and to my amazement, my water pressure issue is completely gone! And my water, which is extremely hard in my town, actually tastes better too!! I'm so glad I spent the extra cash and bought name-brand! These filters are worth EVERY penny!",5
284202,42,"After some hard use with our Keurig, we decided it was time to replace some of the parts... and WOW is there a difference! This item worked wonders for our K-cups.  No more ""dull maybe sorta piercings"" - perfect every time.",5
64950,42,"[[VIDEOID:331263f70b26ecec0e940d5da6cc0fa0]] I purchased item and had to return. It was making this terrible screeching sound and not producing much ice. It also did a cleaning mode where water was running into the ice that was in the basket causing the ice to become soft and freezing ice nuggets together. I decided to return maker for a replacement one. Thought maybe we just got a bad one. I will say that returning was super easy. Company returned my email promptly. They gave me the option for free UPS pick up at my house since the machine was super heavy. Before the item was picked up they already had one shipping to me and arrived days later. So customer service was spot on. However the second maker not only did the same thing but stopped making ice altogether. Both ice makers broke within the first two weeks of having it. Needless to say, I returned the second one for a full refund.",1

468678,42,"This item shipped very fast. It was a perfect fit. It was easy to install. I removed the rear lint duct and panel and worked through this opening. One screw removes the old pulley and the one new screw that comes with the pulley secures it in place. After the new pulley is installed, just attach the existing spring. I found it easier to install the belt on the small motor pulley first, then push the new pulley up into position behind the belt and engaging it into the new pulley last. I had no issues. It was a simple fix.",5

553704,42,They are plastic squares. They dont really fit. They are cheap looking.,1
664456,42,These are cheaply made of pressed metal plastic and rubber. There are no real bearings per se. They’re more like main bearings in a car where there is simply two pieces of metal riding against each other instead of any type of roller bearings. The original rollers were squeaking which is why I purchased the shed. After installing these the squeak is gone however the dryer simply has a loud almost groaning or droning or humming tone and is actually noisier than before.,1
317621,42,"Item exactly as described, shipping was very fast and worked perfectly!...... until the following week when the door latch assembly needed to be replaced! Do not blame seller at all.

I would expect it will also last as long as an OEM, but too early to say.<br />I do not recall from the manual, but I recommend to run a gallon or so thru the filter right after installation, and before the ice maker is turned on. The first water thru the filter is grey/ black from carbon dust.",5

113705,42,Arrived fast was sealed clean and no problems. All the packages has the same number of packets inside but the larger like 4 & 8 gram packs are the best deal you will find anywhere!

Best deal I found for name brand.,5

521440,42,"This valve allows water to flow into your washer (hot and cold).  It did the trick when our old Whirlpool washer would sputter when the cold water was turned on to fill the machine.  I suspect we had a bad relay, which this assembly includes.  The bracket has several pre-punched/taped holes for various machines and a small rubber reducer to fit various size inlet tubes.  The relays are 120VAC with .250&#34; quick connect tabs.  Recommend this product and suspect that it would work for nearly any mfg washer.",5

I put it in freezer for 10 min and I'm ready to steam some milk with an ice cold pitcher. Shape is great as well and gives good motion and pathways for the steam to travel when steaming your milk. The only draw back I have noticed is that with certain machines (mostly the lower tier machines) the steaming wand is just not long enough for steaming smaller amounts of milk. If you want to steam only 4 or 5 oz, you might have some troubles. Nonetheless this is great and for the price I highly recomend it.",5

If you are looking for a great value in K-cup coffee, this is it...  As others here have mentioned, the build quality is ""cheapish"", but for the price, you really can't do better...

Read instruction and use your head to install it.  I found it relatively easy.  I turned the dryer on after the install and the noise was gone.  Dryer has been working great these past 8 months.  So far so good.  Worth the price.  Much better option economically than getting a new dryer.  Besides, no one brags about their new dryer anymore.  It used to be the greatest conversation ever during family gatherings.  But, sadly times have changed.  Dryer talk went out the window with pay phone conversations.  So buy the kit.

After a few uses the plastic holding on the dials broke. You can still use the machine fine but it can be a guessing game as to where the dials are set to.<br />  I highly recommend that you put it up on something when using so that when it drains the water doesn't collect around the bottom of the machine. I use two boards that went from edge to edge of my bathtub. Another suggestion is to have a lint trap for the bathtub. This has 1 inside that doesn't do to badly but there is still a lot of lint, fuzz, etc that escapes and tries to go down the drain. All in all though it seems to be a good machine.",4

385190,42,"Perfect!  Used to replace Water Inlet Valve on Washer Model LAT8216AA.  The part number is 22001274 and has a 1/2” inlet.  This part worked even though the inlet nipple was smaller at 3/8” because this part came with a piece of tubing That goes over the nipple that made it bigger to fit the 1/2” hose on this washer.  The tubing can be cut away and removed easily so that the part can be used for washers with either 3/8” (Without tubing) or 1/2” (with tubing) inlet.  So, look at the picture and compare your original part to this one.  Measure the inlet nipple and rest assured that if it is 1/2” or 3/8” it will fit.  Also, on the original valve assembly, the electrical ends were on the ends but on this part, they are both on one side.  It didn’t matter at all.  Just pay attention to which wires go onto the cold water side and which go onto the hot before you remove the original part.",5

The second image on the Amazon site, which shows the underside of the knob, matches exactly with the one I was trying to replace but not with the one I received. In the end it works, and was only $10 rather than $50 for an official replacement from GE, but it's not what I thought I was getting.",2

520768,42,"Have purchased this before and it worked fine. Latest purchase worked for about 1 month, then started dispensing water at a drizzle. I removed the filter and put it back in. Then got a warning on my fridge that there was a leak detected and the water and ice were disabled. Tried resetting the filter again, but it will not work at all now. For the exorbitant price, this defect should not occur. Upon experiencing the issue, I saw others have written reviews with the same problems. Amazon was very helpful with the refund.",2

I unplugged it and as I was packing it back in the box to return I noticed something that looked and smelled like oil.,1

If you're used to clean, small town water you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />For $23 it didn't seem worthwhile to send them back. I use the ice made through these, but won't drink the water.

I went to Lowes and picked up a 3M brand 'dryer' tape (it says on the label) and 3 elbows from the HVAC section. These are thicker steel than the elbows in the 'dryer' section which is made of aluminum and are as flimsy as soda cans. For my LG washtower, I cut the factory vent piece about 12 inch long and connected it back to the blower. I did my best to reach in and taped that piece to the blower to prevent it from coming off. Proceeded to connect 1 elbow, then a straightened elbow then another elbow out of the right side to connect to my wall vent. I taped each piece as I connected and the end result was way cheaper and just as sturdy. I only spent about $32 (elbows and tape) with tax.",2

468717,42,Easy to assemble. Was able to reduce the length of two sides by 9cm so it fits the stack of file boxes that will permanently be store on it. Not sure how it would work if used for an appliance or as intended.,5
638555,42,My favorite planners! Enough space for daily items and the size/color is perfect.,5
268502,42,I bought this 3 years ago. It's functioned properly but the plastic has become extremely brittle. It's so brittle that I have to be very careful not to crack or break it more than I already have. I now need to order a new cover or go with a different vent system. I like the design but the cheap plastic is slowly making this product unusable. I would not recommend the product.,1
455338,42,Works fine no drips thank you,5

435847,42,"I’ve been buying these filters for years and I love them.  They cost a fraction of the name brand ones sold at the big box appliance store that are meant to go in my Samsung refrigerator.  They give me good tasting, clean water that we use for drinking and cooking.  I can even guess at how much money I’ve saved over the 10 years I’ve owned this refrigerator but I know it significant.  We change the filters about 4 times per year.  Would probably need to change more often if we didn’t also buy a lot of bottled water just for convenience.  Water flow is reduced as filter fills with contaminants so I know it is catching the bad stuff I don’t want to drink.  We also drink a lot of coffee in my house and use the filtered water from refrigerator to make it.  I get noticeably better tasting coffee useing the water from these filters that’s I do using tap water.  Would recommend these to anyone wanting good tasting water without being ripped off by the expensive filters.",5

465452,42,Use with mini wisk for frothy milk and it is just the right size. Easy to measure with the markings inside and easy to clean.,5
260547,42,This product has saved many messes from dropping between the counter and the stove. It's a great buy; I wish I had purchased one a long time ago!

696203,42,Great item. Too soon to comment on durability. But so far so good.,5
407789,42,The product was a perfect fit and was instantly recognized by the GE fridge. The only thing I noticed is that it is lighter than the GE name brand part. I have no idea whether the water is filtered equivalently to the name brand part but the resulting water looks clear and is odorless.,4

Just purchase two more to keep on hand.<br />Anyway, easy to use - i just attach it to the top of the dryer hose, and hang it on a nail.  Clean it out, when I clean out the dryer screen.",5

This provides the ability to stack (light weight items on top) and the eggs are readily available to grab without removing the bin. It holds 36 large eggs perfectly. I would guess if you needed larger capacity another could be connected on top with the way it is designed. Very pleased with this.",5

However, these pods don't have QR codes and the brewer doesn't recognize that a pod has been inserted.  I have addressed this by cutting the top off a used K-Cup that has a QR code and placing it on top of the pod, but it would be nice to add a QR code to the top of the pod so that the brewer will recognize that coffee has been inserted.  That allows the features to be set manually. Alternatively, there should be some way to bypass the automatic QR code feature and just brew coffee using manual settings.  The QR code feature is a subtle way for Keurig to discourage use of pods that are not sold by Keurig.",3

692460,42,The dryer broke TWO weeks after the warrantee expired. Costway was willing to refund half of the cost of the unit.  NO ONE WILL REPAIR IT. I have contacted big name and small independent repair businesses. But with no resolve. Why?!  ANY suggestions?,1
64172,42,Easy to read and seems to be pretty accurate.  I like it's features and presentation.  Picks up the transmitter signal very well.,5
562373,42,They work just as the Samsung brand and less costly.  Will buy again and eBay makes it easy every time.,5
427573,42,Handy. filters fit perfectly. fun to choose a different color each time,5
281344,42,"I like them better than the hinged ones. Easy to fill, use, and clean.<br />These don't get clogged as much as others I've used.",5
266402,42,"Has a slight, none-bothersome taste even after the prerequisite 2.5 gallons.  However, considering it costs 1/4 the manufacturer, it is completely acceptable.",4
224670,42,"Great! It did arrive cracked though, which is definitely the fault of the shipper. Be careful when bringing your package inside! I just used some Flex tape to fix mine since it was pretty minor.",4
470850,42,Works well- what we were looking for,5
150984,42,Great product.. It looks great on our glass top stove.,5
453950,42,"It works, just make sure the machine is leveled perfectly.",5
357579,42,"Plastic housing was broken and I fixed it ,I really needed it .i did have time to return it and wait for a replacement .",3
515273,42,It's pretty tiny. I can only wash two or three 6x6 towels at a time.<br />The instructions don't come in English.<br />And I can't make it do 1 or 10 minute cycles...it seems to be stuck on 5 minutes.<br />But I didn't buy it for big loads anyway. I bought it for small things and to give my arms a break from scrubbing so it works out.,2
392430,42,"Fit perfectly, easy to change out.",5
2759,42,"Love it perfect solution to the recycle problem created by the pods in the first place! Reduce, reuse, recycle!",5
54650,42,Filter has only been is use 5 days and already not working. My air humidifier is already telling me to change the filter. The back of the filter (the side where the air is drawn in) is hard and no longer absorbs water. Awful product,1
598259,42,Exactly the part we needed. Was easy to install with the guidance from a video on youtube. Saved our $900 washer!,5
667651,42,I was about to spend $40 for a manufacture replacement.  I found this with the same part number for 1/2 the price.  Perfect fit - very happy!,5
659130,42,"These leak and produce muddy coffee. Using paper filters helps, but these do not work as well as the Ekobrew cups.",2
84828,42,Excellent factory replacement better bearings and less money,5
328467,42,They made the stove look new again,5
689178,42,The parts were just what we needed to fix our drawer on the bottom of our oven. One thing that would have helped is a diagram or instructions on where they go. I had to look up a diagram online.,5
51636,42,"After purchasing, the top started to deteriorate and delaminate from underneath.  After replacing the top twice, the third has started to do the same.  Since this was determined to be a cosmetic issue, it’s no longer covered.<br />Cooks great…. Looks terrible!",1
491507,42,Is identical to the Samsung filter only you can save money by purchasing them,5
505562,42,Love it. I use it for my refrigerator.,5
688473,42,"The labels on my Bosch dishwasher's buttons were completely gone. These buttons fit perfectly, and now I know what the different functions are--no more guessing!",5
165520,42,The water tastes better without the filter,1
366849,42,I purchased from Amazon. Much cheaper than Lowes or Home depot. Excellent replacement.,4
447976,42,Prompt delivery.  Item works as advertised,5
664075,42,"It worked, had to rewire harness to connect to my washer",4
138268,42,"I just tried the machine for the forst time and decided to do a test run with water only and I’m glad that I did. This machine splashes heavily. I can only imagine the cleanup if it had been coffee. Also, the place where the cup goes is bot tall enough for a travel mug. On my last machine this was not an issue bc the drain was fully removable so I could just slide the machine forward and place my travel mug under it. This is not the case with this machine. The drain is part of the base and is therefore not removable.",1
376806,42,Our fridge could Not keep up with the amount of ice we need for our house.<br />So we bought this.<br />LOVE it !!!  Makes ice ALL Day Long.<br />  JUST an FYI.....<br />Don't Forget ....<br />To Clean the Inside Once A Week.  Cuz there is a Filth Build Up On Bottom.<br />  & we use Filtered Water.<br />& it does NOT make Noise,5
564994,42,"So far so good, no problems. Coffee taste great, easy to clean.",5
368392,42,Great price and quick delivery plus fit just like a glove,5
301187,42,I don't need any wish to return,5
283168,42,Im a cheapo that doesnt want to buy a coffee maker or filters.  This thing is perfect to brew a single cup for my self.  It takes about 2 mins to pour the water in but you get what you pay for,5
579887,42,Reviews are spot on - my Maytag violently shook and moved across the floor.  Installer blew me off with - “that’s what they do”.  The pads made it quiet and stopped the crazy shaking and walking.  Not an inexpensive product but well worth the price!,5
481213,42,"These are great! I rated a 4 just because the clear ones were not quite as clear as I was hoping.  They re a little more noticeable than I wanted, but otherwise these work perfectly, fit great, and serve the purpose I need.",4
618334,42,"Used these to clamp down the dryer duct, no issues so far.",5
153629,42,2nd belt on same machine hope this one holds up better,4
412170,42,So far it’s a good fan. Takes all the curry smell out of the house,5
164959,42,"Works much better than the stock element, has more rings.",5
11709,42,Replacement was exact fit and in 30 minutes the washing machine was working again...,5
381492,42,Really liked the ease in which was able install the wheels to the rack,4
230542,42,"Holes too small.  I tried different blends of coffee and espresso, different levels of fills, and tamping vs no tamping.  Same result every time.  Pressure built up and sprayed water inside, and made 1/4 the amount of coffee and tasted terrible.",1
119888,42,These are not designed to handle the flow of water on the Keurig machine. I opened a K-cup to check the level of grounds and the degree they were ground before I attempted to use the filter pod. The water bubbled out of the holder and about half spilled out before the cycle was completed.,1
486898,42,I love this little dryer ..I wish I ordered the larger size yet I am not unhappy and I do recommend this product.,3
106231,42,The Maytag filters work as intended and are an OEM replacement part for my Maytag refrigerator. Decent price as well.,5
364917,42,This filter is defective (leaks) and I am returning it to you.  Would consider keeping the schedule if it is replaced with no cost/trouble to me.,1
465974,42,This part worked great for my dfg-50 1993 model Blodgett oven.,5
488953,42,My wife and I were camping at the beach. The family next to us had a portable ice maker and let us get ice for our drinks. My wife has to have ice in her drinks period. So when I saw the Oline ice machine with a 5 year warranty in one of the pictures to the left it was a no brainer to get it. Very pleased with the amount of ice it produces and how fast it fills the basket. Now we can take it camping. It’s nice that any melted ice is recirculating to make new ice. The smaller size easily fits into water bottles. Glad I purchased the Oline over the other options.,5
199833,42,"It looks great and a great price however, even at the lowest setting this thing is LOUD. Also sometimes the touch buttons do not react to touch and you have to press it a few times to get it to work.",3
548766,42,"Thank goodness to YouTube, I replaced the dryer heating element on my own. It was a little tedious, but nothing hard and well worth the savings.",5
89768,42,"I'm not sure if these actually work. However, the refrigerator manual recommends using them and Amazon is the cheapest I found to purchase them.",5
31489,42,Because my Maytag dryer was over 20 years old I was afraid I would not be able to find this motor. It's a perfect fit and now that I realize it's left hand thread to take off the blower it makes it much easier. Very happy,5
210041,42,Works for me as a single person.  Not sure if it makes enough for a family.  It sure beats emptying ice trays.  Perfect for me.,5
345316,42,This is exactly what I needed.  Works perfectly with my coffee maker.,5
672886,42,"Great sealer, easy to use, heat control that you can seal almost any thickness cellophane or sealable plastics.  For the price a bargin",5
10446,42,"I had 2 very exspensive machines put in by samsung, I expected that on installing I would have to find my own hookups for my washer and dryer. On day of installation, the Samsung workers straight up ignored and refused to use them, out of fear of failure. So if Samsung wouldn't trust to use these devices than I probably wouldn't recommend them either. In fear of failure and the risk of extreme damage.",3
198905,42,I used this to stop the water in my drawers.  Worked like a charm.,5
232435,42,These are perfect for my 10 ml squeeze tubes. Instead of covering the whole tube it just cover where you unscrew the top at.,5
307615,42,"I ordered this after finding out they no longer sold the stacking kit at any of my local hardware stores (Lowes, Homedepot, HH Greggs, or Bestbuy).  I used some PlastiDip and painted it black to  make my units.  Saved a lot of need space by stacking  them. I'm not sure why everyone doesn't stack their units.",5
325002,42,Live the little filters.<br />Make clean up a breeze,5
698,42,Previously purchased a different brand burner. It was actually dangerous to use. Pots and pans wanted to slide right off the burner. This one fit perfectly and pots and pans stay put! Definitely recommend!,5
258807,42,Don't forget to sanitize.  Humidity is important but so is your health,5
91087,42,This arrived quicker than expected! It was installed last night and oven working perfectly. Thank you!,5
37848,42,Received much faster than anticipated and fit like very well,5
324920,42,Broke a week after!!!!<br />Just threw money in the trash.,1
667797,42,"Fit perfectly with the Keurig reusable cup. This came in perfect quality and was exactly like the one that came with the original reusable cup. Coffee tastes a lot better again after putting in this new filter!<br /><br />EDIT: I'm on the 3rd Reusable filter. They're great! They last for about 1 year each, until the filter becomes too clogged (coffee dust builds up between the two filter screens) or until one of the filter screen rips from the plastic walls. These help you save money and use less plastic. The best part is being able to use your favorite coffee beans in your Keurig!",5
21926,42,Just sitting with the humidifier not running the top is barely moist. I always flip it over before I start. I run it on low and about 20 minutes or so the top is way to dry. I flip it back over to restart the process. I keep the water level at or very near the top with distilled water. The filter has no build up it just does not hold moister very well.,3
129976,42,"The bracket worked great, easy to install and very secure.",5
260037,42,"The nut hokding this on to the top of tge dishwasher apparently fell off. Water leaking into corroded connections, forcing error shutdown. After replacing both this unit and the nut, things are fine again.",5
458341,42,Fast shipping and saved a ton fixing this myself.  Door not shutting tight?  Replace these in 10 minutes.,5
366464,42,I purchased this because I had ground coffee I needed to brew in my Keurig Vue. This works great. Allows me to brew coffee grounds in the little filter pod without any issues.,5
642654,42,I would not buy again. It was less expensive than the other brand but would rather spend more money and get quality taste.,2
565439,42,Work like coffee filter are supposed to work,5
546571,42,Don't put anything jot on it I use a glass cutting board looks nice and hi can put hot stuff from oven now,5
561364,42,package is professionally wrapped and easy to take out of package to install into your  Keurig water reservoir.,5
353252,42,"Took less than 10 minutes to install in our dryer, works great.  This is an original (OE) Whirlpool part manufactured and sold by Whirlpool (the box it arrived in also stated such).  Coil is heavy and thick, not the thin type made in China.  For the few extra bucks buy this element, you won't regret it.",5
279344,42,"For the money, this was a good investment. I’m an inpatient person, so I think it makes my ice too slow, but In specs, it makes it as the time says. Well worth it. Very easy to use.",5
319569,42,I bought 2 as gifts and 1 for myself and love it!  It's magnetic but doesn't scratch my black stainless dishwasher.  Now there's no more guessing if dishes are clean or dirty.  Colors & size of print make it very easy to read.,5
474143,42,"Good product, works great, delivered fast.",5
267856,42,"I have Vertuoline and bought this '70ml set'. I was so excited to get this once I read all reviews, but whenever used this capsule, it's too watery. It is not like espresso at all. It's more like brewed coffee. I will return it if it works like this again.",1
69634,42,"My fridge did not have one when I moved into my new place...  works great!  Not sure why there's a lid - but ok - I don't use the lid - but i guess some people would like it...  I like the blue because its my fav color - doesn't match anything, but I'm fine with that - it's for eggs...  :)",5
665931,42,"Great overall, but installing hardwares were wrong. I got the same hooks for the chimney pieces, whereas they should have been of different lengths to accommodate the different sizes of the telescoping parts. It's also on the noisy side when operating on the high speed. Loved the timer that allows you the keep the fan running for some time, then turning off automatically.",4
176861,42,Product is warped enough to come off easily.,1
404973,42,"Perfect inexpensive fix for the problem, however, here we are 8 months later replacing it again. But.. we have a 6 person 4 dog household so our machine is used much more often with heavier loads than most..",4
591218,42,"[[VIDEOID:cf7c25db4e59264a8ceb5e953677fabe]] First of all,this is really beyond what I expected. This machine enough big to wash whole family clothes.I have used it for couple months and had no any issues until now. Washing is really good,spins very gently and dryer works well.I’m satisfying with this purchase.",5
310728,42,I thought it was a periscope not a piece for a dryer,1
337312,42,price was good and so was the service. Natural color is supposed to be healther,5
267093,42,"The instructions are useless. Poor installation...nothing is marked for measuring, top hood is adjustable and slides into the lower hood without a way to attach them together so measuring this peace is difficult to make your dimensions on the wall. Also the screws and anchors are worthless for attaching the vent, which needs good quality screws because of it's weight. Overall, I would not have purchased this if I knew how awkward the installation would be. You have to screw the brackets with the hood attached to them, which means you have to fit your hand underneath, and the cheap metal will cut your hand! We are having to get new GOOD quality screws and anchors that won't strip the wall and we will finish this job tomorrow....If we hadn't done so much work already, I would return it. Hope it at least looks good when it's all done, then maybe it will be worth it. FYI, the man installing this is a construction engineer that can put anything together!!! so we will get it done, but definitely would have paid extra for a better product!!!!<br />UPDATE: installation is complete, we had to drill new holes in the hood because the pre-cut ones were way too high and you couldn't reach them. In the end, it looks good and works well. But I would still not recommend this product, installation was a nightmare.",2
395623,42,"Very functional and attractive too. Nice quality, it looks good sitting by the coffee machine. You can pull out one K-cup without the others catching and falling out.",5
86039,42,"Couldn't handle the pressure, made a mess in fridge. Switched back to ge brand.",1
582220,42,"No other filter matches our Bunn machine like these.  Other filters are too short and allow grounds into the pot.  These filters are also made of high-end paper, so the flavor of the coffee comes through really well.  Definitely worth shopping for.",5
499370,42,"The water levels is the problem. You can't put too much or too little water in the compartment, because the unit senses and shuts itself off...doesn't produce ICE. The unit I had before this one, you could put as much water in the unit and it work with endless ICE, until  the internal cut off...kicks in.",3
642485,42,Went defective when it began making grinding noises seventeen days after the thirty-day return warranty period ended,1
529438,42,Fit right in the machine. Great quallity.,5
9231,42,they came right away but sorry to say they did not fit my refrigaretor,1
463439,42,"I'm using it as I type this. This little machine is truly wonderful for me. I recently moved from a house with washer & dryer to a tiny one bedroom apartment, so after &#34;rediscovering&#34; the wonders of a laundromat 3 blocks away & also getting to play &#34;guess what the people before me put in these same machines&#34;, I knew I needed to find something else. Now, the washing is wonderful, detergent use is minimal & I have found that my clothes are indeed much cleaner. Yes, it's not automatic & yes, as others said, you do have to add water and such, but I am doing my laundry at home, in my own machine.<br /><br />The dryer is sort of different as it is spin only and no heat, so while clothes, if you do do smaller loads, come out about 80% or more dry  you still need to hang them for a few hours. And yes, I have now had to reeducate myself on how to iron again :(  as without a heated tumble dryer my clothes do come out wrinkled, but again, I'm not schlepping my laundry to the mat and all that. All in all a very worthwhile investment and one that I am not regretting. This may not be for everyone but for those of you that dont mind a bit of hands on and want to save trips out this may be the answer.",5

474556,42,"Replacing a hunk of Kenmore junk that was purchased in '06 with this in Oct.'12.. Although the Kenmore only needed 2 repairs during this time the main complaints was it's inability to get clothes clean and the moldy smell that permeated the clothing as well. We had my son's bedding get a dingy brown for a couple of years of dog duty and planning on tossing it. No need, after one pass through the 412 now white again!. I notice that there is a class action against Sears and possibly LG who makes those mouldy monsters.",5
134432,42,Recently upgraded a few appliances in our kitchen and added this beauty. It works great! We cook everyday 3 times a day most of which is indian good.

541971,42,bad experience and defective product amazon refused to help they referd  me back to the vendor. Ive called amazon 5 times same answer.  china tells me i cant return it because well they wont accept it,1
215395,42,Loves these colors! The snap lid allows for a non messy brew and they have a tactile clue on the lid which is nice for knowing how to align it in the machine or to find the release for the lid more easily. Helpful for blind/visually impaired individuals! Nothing with coffee grounds is ever easy to clean but these are straightforward cleaning wise. Enjoy!,5
77880,42,"Installed products successfully,<br />Work very well and vegetable are more fresh and refrigerator smells very good<br />Will definitely recommend",5

509947,42,"Not much to say here... It's a filter that goes in the fridge to filter our water and ice. It's very easy to install, just open the small door, pull old one out, line up two notches (inlet and outlet), push in and close the door. Very simple to install. Don't forget to run 2 gallons of water before use! It's just to make sure any lose material runs out and isn't ingested.",4
148772,42,We buy these frequently and the price just gets better. The 2 pack is the way to go as the per unit price is unbeatable. These work with the Hario filter holder and make a good/great pour over method even better.,5
148562,42,Only regret I have is not buying sooner.  These are awesome.  I also purchased the paper filters & it works great.  So much cheaper than buying the prefilled K cups.  I absolutely would not hesitate to buy.,5

98086,42,"I initially bought two of the keurig brand re-usable k cups thinking that theirs would work best. I was completely wrong. I tried them in my own keurig as well as a few of the machines at work (all different models of keurig machines).They mostly just made a mess and caused water to overflow from the machine into the coffee cup making watery coffee. These re-usable k cups worked perfectly and I was able to buy eight of them for the price of one keurig brand re-usable k cup. They’re easy to clean, take less coffee to fill them so it’s less expensive per cup, and they make good coffee. I would definitely recommend them if you’re looking for re-usable k cups.",5
105659,42,Arrived a little sooner than predicted! Same quality as OEM.,5
655800,42,Could be a little bit better on quality.,4
687855,42,I love this machine.  Once I replaced my faucet it was easy to install and works perfectly.  My faucet had a builtin sprayer that was not compatible with the hookup.  The pressure kept forcing the sprayer to engage.  Even with replacing my faucet I would highly recommend this.,5

587758,42,"I got these for one reason and one reason only: to deal with the nasty silt that accumulated using my reusable, non-keurig brand, k-cup pod.  I had a very nice pod, but ended up packing it away when my cups were always filled with silt.  I somehow misplaced it after a move and got the 4 for $10 as seen on TV reusable pods at my local grocery store.  Them, plus the filters equals a delicious cup of coffee from my Keurig with out a lot of waste and cost.  There is really only one down side, they are a little small, so I can't get as strong a cup of coffee as I may like, but that can be remedied with a different type of grind.  I read review after review trying to find out if these would cut back on silt, but none that I saw stated one way or the other.  I decided to bite the bullet and just order them.  Well, I'm glad I did, because that's exactly what they do.  So, if that's what you're curious about, no more wondering.  And they still taste like K-cups, not gross drip coffee.  Plus, they arrived very quickly in minimal, recyclable packaging :)",5

695405,42,Wow. Can I repeat wow. Seriously wow,5
485372,42,"Like some others, I used one sideways on the stove (long side in the crack) and trimmed the top to be level with the stove top.  Worked like a charm and is barely noticeable.  I also used one to bridge the gap between the countertop and refrigerator (which was 1 1/4"")!  Lastly, I used one to bridge the gap between the bathroom sink and wall.  As you can see, I used the clear ones - 25""  So far, I'm loving them!  I gave them 5 stars for the ""heat resistance,"" but doubt they will be tested for that feature.",5
650253,42,I ordered this because my dryer stopped heating so I thought I'd give it a shot. And I received it next day and installed it all on my own well with a little help from YouTube. But again being a first timer it was pretty simple. And I'm a GIRL!! Lol just had to point that out as well. And I'm not in a kind of way into building or fixing things but I don't do laundrymats so this was a must. But it was very easy just make sure to snap a pic or mark which wire goes where before u start unhooking.good luck,5
647364,42,Delivered on time and works perfectly. Gave an old dryer new life!,5
252788,42,"So this thing produces ice yes, however it doesn’t keep it cold so you can’t just turn it on and walk away for an hour. I run mine and pour the ice into a bin I keep in my freezer. If you leave it, it will melt. Another thing. The ice is pretty wet when it is produced and I was so unhappy I almost returned it as it would all stick together and clump and be impossible to separate after being in my freezer for a while. So I figured out, when you dump the ice with other ice, give it a mix with the scoop so it’s not wet any more and voila, solved the problem! I’m in apartment living for a bit after owning a house with two ice makers so I got beyond spoiled but this works just fine. Takes a bit of effort but it’s great.",4

100265,42,"It holds 1 gallon of water which makes 8.3 pounds of ice. A light comes on when it needs refilling. Collect each batch of cubes when you hear them drop into the bin, because they will melt if you just leave them there. Put the cubes into a container in the freezer. If you buy a gallon of water and cool it in the fridge overnight, the cubes will be made faster.<br /><br />Two drawbacks: It takes a long time to freeze the whole gallon into cubes, 4-6 hours. If you live near a grocery store, it is cheaper and faster to buy 10 pound bags of ice for home use. Also, it is a bit awkward  to rinse all the soapy water from the inside after you clean it.",4

257463,42,"This plugged into my compressor and I connected the wire harness. That was it. Worked like a charm. My fridge and freezer works perfectly now. If your compressor kicks on for 5 seconds and then kicks on again 45 seconds later, its probably the relay. Saved myself a lot of money doing it myself over calling a repair service. I would have paid 80 bucks for them to tell me that I needed a 60 dollar part (that's $12 on amazon) that they would provide plus the hourly rate to install. I'll take the 12 dollar part and 10 minutes of my own time instead. Good luck, I hope it works for you.",5

I have bought before and will buy again when I again need filters.",5
105965,42,"Purchased the 50"" Pioneer several months ago and have been totally satisfied with the performance of this television. The picture in high definition is crystal clear with unbelievable color. I spent a great deal of time researching plasma, lcd and dlp televisions before deciding on this model.<br /><br />There is no comparable television on the market that can match the picture or quality of this model. While there are less expensive products on the market, the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is applicable here.<br /><br />Having a seperate media center for cable, dvd, and receiver connections is a major advantage over having cables connected to the screen. I've mounted the TV on the wall, and while a little time consuming, was relatively simple.<br /><br />When not viewing digital programming, the picture is comparable to viewing regular television and acceptable.<br /><br />You would be challenged to find another plasma comparable to the Pioneer.",5

405922,42,"I raise my own chickens, meaning that I normally have a surplus of eggs.  I got this device hoping that it would make storage easier.  Turns out that it does just the opposite.  I do not know if I am doing it wrong, but loading the eggs is easy, loading them oldest on top is hard to do.  There are three spring-loaded trays with 10 holes each. I organize the trays so the tray with the oldest eggs is on top.  After I use those eggs, I have to empty out the other trays and move every egg to the next level up, then do it again when THAT tray is empty.  The only way to avoid this is to load 30 eggs and use them all, then load 30 again.  It is so much easier to just use egg cartons., You can move the entire carton instead of the individual eggs.<br />One improvement that I would recommend is the ability to rearrange the trays.  Of course, that would degrade the strength of the egg holder.  Another would be to encapsulate the spring that flips the egg tray up.  I have had to re-insert those springs several times, which resulted in me knocking stars off the review.",3

At this point I had to go out and buy another dryer.  I called LG to ask for a return or at a minimum a $500 reimbursement for the dryer I had to buy.

The seal was leaking all over the floor and service tech came out wiped it down and said, &#34;It just needs cleaning from time to time around the rim of the door.&#34;  I had a Maytag previously and never had to do that?  Then I started to notice a musty smell in my towels.  I use affresh, and wipe the rubber seal all around with clorox wipes and leave the door open to prevent mold.  I started using hot water and bleach to see if towels would smell fresher, It was a bit better.  The other day I looked inside the rubber seal with a flashlight and it is covered with hardened BLACK MOLD! YUCK.  I immediately contacted Whirlpool extended warranty and guess what, &#34;Your extended warranty only covers mechanical and electrical. Not mold.&#34;<br />The transferred me to Whirlpool service to learn what I can do to remedy the mold and was told, &#34;All we can do is order a new seal, 106.00 and send a service tech to replace it, labor 80 - 100.00.  WHAT??? This is a defect in design obviously, but they will not stand by the product.  So now I'll be looking for a new machine.  My best friend bought a Samsung and loves it.

I use it in the single cup model from 2012. It is more work to empty and fill the basket than a pod, but at almost a dollar a pod, it will pay for itself, it's worth the extra minute.

548368,42,"So far so good! I love this washer! Its big inside and holds about 5 to 6 plus size tanks/tees with undies in a load. I have some stretching pants that are heavy and the machine did not like them much but everything else seems good except the hookup to kitchen sink. There is a problem going from fine thread to the thread for a hose and I had to buy a three dollar piece. Not a big deal but had to make a special trip when I personally thought it was an obvious problem and the part should have been included or even shipped separately in case it was needed. I had heard this is a problem in other reviews. The other problem I see that is temporary for me is that the whole sink portion of the hook up hangs down so far from the sink that to leave the set up attached is a pain and the only thing worse is taking it off after each use.(can't run dishes under to rinse easily). It is a bit ackward to move in front of sink and the hookup shoots out water if I don't manually turn off and on between each cycle, again for me temporary because I will be doing a hard hookup in my bathroom soon. I read somewhere that the lint in some of these washers are a problem but this one has two lint traps, one on each side of drum and they do collect well. I would have really liked this product on wheels, I know they make these and would buy them even if not recommended if my situation was not temporary. (I can't see it being good for the machine to be bounced around as I get it into place each time. I found securing the hose between a dish drying rack makes me more comfortable. At first I did npt understand the hook on the hose moved but all in all to short by about 8 inches for the kitchen sink but perfect if it sat on a rolling base, lol",4

Additionally, the air filters are a completely different design and again no where near the correct size. We exchanged messages for a week or two. I sent them pictures of my refrigerator name plate info. It was ultimately a waste of time. They seemed to agree that I had purchased the correct filter kit. No effort was made to provide a product that works for my refrigerator. They made no offer to allow me to send it back for a refund.

270491,42,"Bought this as a replacement for my Samsung oven and it works so I guess that's what really matters. I'm sure it's not as good as the OEM product but it was also a 1/5 of the price. So even if I have to buy one every couple of years instead of five years they're still a good deal. Ease of installation in this case was a 4 mostly because you have to have a bit of knowledge and dismantle your oven to get the old one out. Overall swapping it is a breeze but getting to it does require some time, effort and skill. Longevity is going to be something that needs more time to evaluate but I gave it a 5 star because I'm hopeful. As I said a 1/5 of the price of OEM.",5

Overall a solid purchase, and I'm ordering another for the office.<br /><br />Update: the cooler no longer cools water - we still have hot, but despite the compressor running, no cooling at all. Still, it lasted 3.5 years. I bought it for $200, which means we used it HARD for .15 cents/day for delicious hot & cold. I’m not mad.",4

It is 72 lbs and needs to be screwed into wood, so find a truss or crossbeam. I put a couple 2x4 nailers in the attic and screwed into them.<br />Second, the display is in 24 hr format and the clock runs fast. Not a big deal though because it is only displayed when the unit is on. It is easy to ignore.<br />Third (and this is why 4 stars instead of 5)....there were a couple dings on it, which we didn't notice until it was installed. Rather than go through the effort of taking it down, re-packaging and returning, we just chose to live with it.<br />So overall, this seems to be a solid unit and well worth the price.",4

322993,42,"Sometimes, I have trouble trusting 5star reviews, but I had to leave one for this dishwasher. I. Love. It! I'm so happy with my purchase!<br /><br />It's big, and doesn't slide under my cabinets, so it hangs over my countertop slightly. And that's my only con, so far. I've had this for a few months and I run in a few times per week. It's big enough inside to wash smaller pots and pans with a few extra things. It's fairly quiet. You do hear the water swooshing and you hear when the machine changes modes - i.e. from washing to draining. I can't tell you how loud this is in decibels, but I get hearing sensitivity sometimes, and this doesn't bother me. Especially if there's ANYTHING else making sounds at the same time - music, tv, etc. I specifically wanted something with a tank, so I didn't have to hook it up to the sink. That means, all I had to do was hook up the drainage tube (super easy), plug it in, fill it up and it was ready to go!<br /><br />I use the short, 29 min cycle and it gets everything clean. Yes, I pre-wash any stuck on food, but I've done that for every dishwasher I've ever used.<br /><br />There's an optional dry cycle for an hour after the cleaning cycle ends. I generally let it run for about 10-15 mins and then I pull the dishrack out and let it dry on the counter. Then, I either let the drying cycle run with no dishes inside to dry out the machine, or I turn it off and leave the tank lid off and the door slightly open for the same reason. Sometimes, this cycle bothers me, but not because it's loud, it's not. Just because it's a constant hum. It will continue humming after the hour until you press the power button or unplug the machine.<br /><br />CONS: Doesn't fit under my cabinets, but none of the countertop dishwashers on Amazon would.<br />Sometimes the constant hum of the drying cycle bothers me. Because it's constant, not because it's too loud. But any music or tv or other distraction solves this issue immediately<br /><br />PROS: Dishwashing! Lol<br />It's not loud.<br />It has multiple cycles. I like the short one.<br />The short cycle gets everything clean.<br />Water tank, so no need to hook it up to a faucet to run it.<br />Keeps my kitchen sink empty<br />Can wash smaller pots and pans<br />Great for one person who cooks or who doesn't<br />Worth it!",5

101109,42,"Domestic apartment dryers range from $600.00 to $1,200.00. Chinese companies must be selling these at or below cost to grab a share of the American market. There are dryers that put out more heat (for 120 volt outlet) but I wouldn't feel safe leaving them running when I'm not there. The 1300 watts does the job just fine. I have to do two loads that would only take one, in a regular dryer. I figure that It'll take 3 to 4 years for the dryer to pay for itself, and I don't need to keep all those quarters on hand to feed the apartment owner's dryer. You'll have to leave the window open, as all that moisture for the dryer exhaust tends to build up. Being winter, I time it so that I'm running the dryer and leave the window open when I need to leave to do whatever.",5

The porcelain top is very resilient; despite many spills and stains everywhere, we have been able to perfectly clean the glass top every time. The heating patterns provide a great cooking surface. The oven can be separated into two parts to cook two different items at once. The oven can be used as a conventional or convection oven. The bottom heating drawer works well.

As you can see in the first picture there was a  indentation on the box and that is exactly where the damage on the machine was. Fortunately the damage was only cosmetic and did not affect the performance of the machine, so I decided to keep it rather than go through the hassle of returning it for a new machine.<br />The machine works beautifully. It is runs quietly and the clothes come out exceptionally clean. The spin cycle is fantastic because the clothes are wrung out very well and dry very quickly when hung to dry. I would highly recommend this portable washing machine. However I would recommend getting the rolling dolly cart if you have to move it to the sink each time you use it as it is rather cumbersome to move.",4

We are fairly handy so used YouTube videos to diagnose the problem and try to fix it rather than pay bigger bucks to have a service person come in to do it. Bottom line, the burner failed and we were able to find a replacement, which cost us a total of about $100. We successfully installed it, but now the heat doesn't regulate properly. It may be that the switch failed too. To say we're disappointed in a product that cost us $1,1000 that lasted only two years is an understatement. The age of expensive disposable appliances is frustrating!",1

48023,42,"Everything works great, looks fine, just as I’d hoped. Delivery and set up included and they even took our old one for free.",5
401321,42,"I bought these hoping they would fit our Model #:JGP5030SLSS and for those that are seeking to use these to replace the cheap plastic knobs on the JGP5030SLSS be warned they do not fit. However if you’re handy and are willing to jump through some hoops they can be made to fit and I will explain how I managed to do it for anyone wanting to give it a go.<br /><br />So the first thing to do is to remove the plastic insert in these replacement metal knobs and to do that I had to first pull out the metal D rings and then use progressively larger drill bits till the remaining material was easy to pull out.<br /><br />Next I used a Dremel to cut the stems off of the original plastic knobs; the perfect length is actually a bit shorter than the fully available stem length.<br /><br />The last step is a bit tricky and involves taking a small stub narrow pliers to push the sawed off stem piece into the new knob stem. It’s a very tight fit and is a bit counter intuitive in that the flat sides are 180 degrees opposite, which is fine, the fit will still be very tight and once in will require considerable force to push onto the gas valve stems and they will not easily come off after installing, so much so that I don’t think we will typically remove them but rather just clean them in place.<br /><br />The final completed job is awesome and worth the effort but I’m pretty handy and so this is not for the typical person looking for an easy turn key solution. Unfortunately after exhaustively searching for metal knobs for our model and coming up empty, this was the only option. I colored the little dots in with some blue sharpie if your wondering, this was done just to add a little something extra, it’ll probably wear off but for now they look like blue sapphires.<br /><br />I left the ease of install unrated because my thinking is that if these were going on the intended product they would be much easier.",4

135251,42,Did exactly what I expected to. We bought a house with an older disposal and the gasket/rubber that blocks things from falling down into the disposal was cut away. I replaced and is like new. It makes the disposal sound much better too. A couple things about removing disposal and installing gasket...1) use a large Allen key (short end) to stick in the eyelet to unlock the disposal. 2) the gasket fits over the mouth of the disposal and locks into place. Don't just stick the new gasket in up from the bottom hole like I did. 3) use channel locks to tighten the last bit of the disposal/sink collar by pinching the eyelet and  collar screw mount. Enjoy!,5

476819,42,I bought this hoping to filter out the impurities in my water so I could use my Britta less. I tested the water after installing it and running 4 gallons of water thru the filter and got the following results;<br />1. My tap water; 246 (meaning it has a lot of impurities and metals in the water)<br />2. Water from fridge with Waterdrop filter added; 224 ( heavy impurities with a lot of metals)<br /><br />As you can see there isn’t a lot of difference between the two. The water should be at most around 80-90. The water run thru my Brita 5 stage filter tests out at .01 which is awesome. Just shows you how much crap your putting in your body with the water your trying to be healthy with drinking. I’m returning these and going to keep trying other filters until I find one that works as it is supposed to work.,1

There are many other similar products sold for cheaper, do not buy this one.",1
16577,42,"This is my personal use case. You may have a different situation, you may have exactly what I do. My purchase was spurred by a desire to have a washing machine in my apartment after being displaced from a home with a washer and dryer.<br /><br />First off, it beats handwashing or scouring the town for a place to get quarters. I have the machine in my bathroom. I leave it outside the tub when storing, and in the tub when using. If you can lift a full clothes hamper to put in the car and run down to the laundromat, then you can lift this. This machine has done boxers and socks, a week of shirts, a couple bath towels and dish towels, and properly done one pair of jeans at a time. The best way to handle most loads is to do a wash load in the wash side, drain, do the same load with fabric softener, drain, spin half, spin the other half. The spin bucket will definitely jump if it's off-balance. Stop the spin, re-seat the clothes, try again. Once it finishes, hang clothes on hangers to dry. (I say one pair of jeans properly because I could not get the agitator to actually move two pairs around in the tub. Better to do one clean and take a little longer than to shove them in and have them come out dirty. No point in that, best to do it right.)<br /><br />This is not a massive miracle washer, nor will it spin things completely dry in most cases, especially for jeans. I have intentions on getting a low power front-loading dryer or hanging fan dryer to complement it, especially for the jeans. But, my clothes get clean, and I can even watch the water as it drains to see exactly how clean. Little weird thing, I know, but it does something for me.<br /><br />I could say there are more convenient products out here, but they will cost you more and are physically heavier. This does the job just fine and fits my needs and purposes perfectly. When it's laundry day, you do the work, but you don't have to run out to do it. Suits me fine.",4

277204,42,"This was ordered as a replacement for a switch that caused the 8-inch element to turn red-hot. The Magic Chef has been used for 30 years. I was not sure this switch would be a satisfactory replacement. It appeared to have the correct number of wiring contacts, and the current it could handle was the higher amount - 8.9 - 11 amperes.<br /><br />The length of the shaft is about an eighth of an inch shorter than my original, and the entire switch was mounted sideways so OFF would be on top, just as it is on all the three other original switches. I used my laser temperature 'gun' to determine that the LO was the lower temperature and the HI was the higher temperature.<br /><br />Other than those two points, the switch is a satisfactory replacement for the 30-plus year-old switch which controls the large eight-inch burner. The indicators on the replacement (Frigidaire) switch - L1, L2, H1, H2 and P - all coincide with the indicators on the original (Magic Chef).<br /><br />If I remember in the future, I'll update on whether this switch lasted any length of time.<br /><br />UPDATE: Middle of August 2017 and the switch is still functioning as it did when it was first installed.

258591,42,"I bought this a few months ago in an attempt to alleviate my family's need to go to the laundromat. This could not have been a worse decision. This washing machine requires you to replace your sink's aerator in order to connect it, the tube for dirty water to drain only comes with a hook that works with a specific type of sink and wouldn't hook onto mine. And when I have it held to the tub so that it can drain there, I have to have several soaked towels hold it down. This is because the tube is barely long enough to get to the edge of the tub. The towels holding it need to be soaked to have the weight needed to hold the tube. Otherwise, it will fall off of the tub and start flooding the floor. The hose to the sink isn't long enough to comfortably use it anywhere away from the sink. Same issue with the power cord. I had to put a power strip in the bathroom in order to have enough cord length. It goes without saying that this could be a serious fire hazard and after every use, I remove the power strip.<br /><br />I cannot and will not recommend this to anybody. It's the worst possible way to handle it.",1
436700,42,"At first I wondered if this was the right part, as the wash arm it was to replace was somewhat different in shape, although the dishwasher model numbers listed for this part matched that of our machine.<br /><br />There are metal clips near each end of the wash arm's underside that, with the OEM wash arm, rubbed against the heating element in the bottom of the machine, preventing the arm from making complete revolutions as it sprayed. I suspect that this is what caused the previous wash arm to melt badly on the underside, as it was obvious upon inspection that high heat had been conducted to the plastic by the metal clips, virtually destroying the plastic underside of the wash arm near and around the clips. So, before installing the new wash arm, I applied some thumb pressure to the strips where they naturally curve a bit and enhanced the arc of those curved areas until they cleared the heating elements and allowed the wash arm to rotate freely through 360 degrees with no drag. That appears to have solved the wash arm issues. I also removed, cleaned, and reinstalled the screen and debris trap, which solved the issue of the machine's failure to properly clean a normal load of pre-rinsed dishes. All is well once again with our Frigidaire dishwasher. I would have given this part 5 stars were it not for the issue with the metal clips. Otherwise, it works fine.",4

Our only reservation is the light which is located toward the back and the light bulbs  supplied with it do not illuminate our stove top enough. The instructions that came with the vent recommend a limit to the wattage of the bulbs you use which is just not enough light  to see the food well as you are cooking. I plan to call the company to see if brighter bulbs are advisable.,4
132174,42,"I am a consultant and travel almost weekly. When I arrive at the hotel, I unpack, hang my suits and shirts, and steam them one by one. It takes me about 5-7 minutes to do a shirt and suit. I suspect it would take others a little less. This product works well. I have not had any spillage issues as some of the other reviews have indicated. I suspect the issue is improper holding of the device (when full, hold the device perpendicular to the clothing while steaming). The device is small, but not too small. It's my first steamer, but I suspect a smaller steamer would not generate enough steam and would take longer to cover the same surface area. I've had it for several months.<br /><br />The one issue is some calcium build-up. It happens quickly. Simply rinsing it out gets rid of most of it. I will shortly try the vinegar solution to eliminating the build-up.<br /><br />I recommend the product.",4

The one thing that always bothered me about this dishwasher was how long a normal cycle would run.  Never had a dishwasher that took so long to wash a load of dishes. Didn't like the silverware baskets either.  I have the Maytag Bravo washing machine as well.

186346,42,"Dear Mr Riddle,<br /><br />It it with disappointment that I am writing you about my experience with my LG french door refrigerator. I purchased this refrigerator from Home Depot on 12/7/15. It was installed in my new kitchen in April 2016. I liked refrigerator and all of its features so I was upset when it started intermittently making a loud vibrating sound in July.  The sound was coming from the fan behind the filter. As the appliance is covered under the one year manufacturers warranty, I called LG customer service and was told to call a local appliance servicer called &#34;Reliable Appliance Service&#34; myself. The noise stopped by the next day and everything seemed to be working so I never called the service center.<br /><br />Then, sometime during the week of August 22nd the noise started again. Within the week the fan stopped working. All the food on the top of the fridge was warm and everything on the bottom froze. Additionally the ice and water dispenser stopped working and the letters &#34;E rF&#34; were displayed. I called customer support hoping they could tell me what was wrong. They again told me again to call Reliable Appliance Service. I called Reliable Appliance Service and they said that LG needs to schedule the repair or it will be treated as a cash ticket. I called customer support again and was told that they need to submit a request to their service locator team. Several days passed and I heard nothing. By this time all of my food was spoiled.<br /><br />On Friday September 2nd I once again called customer support and was told that they still haven't found a servicer. They would prioritize my case with the service locator team and would return my call on Tuesday, September 6. I never heard back so I called customer support again on Thursday September 8th. I was told that they were still trying to find a servicer that would be willing to come to my house 40 miles from Anchorage, Alaska, and that there was nothing more that they could do.<br /><br />Needless to say by this time I am angry and exhausted. My refrigerator has been broken for over two weeks and your company has conveniently absolved themselves of any duty to fix the problem. Thankfully, Home Depot is willing to pick up the refrigerator and give me a refund. They will be here on Saturday September 10. I will then buy a GE refrigerator.<br /><br />In the mean time I am telling everyone I know to avoid LG products as the appliances are very unreliable and customer service is unwilling to help. I am sure that you have an interest in keeping your company reputation in good standing with potential customers and therefore I am hoping that by informing you of my experience you can assist your team to make a better product and improve customer service.<br /><br />At the very least your company should have been willing to pick up the appliance from my home and take it into servicer. Instead I was offered no help what-so-ever. I have spent hours on the phone with absolutely no interest on your company's behalf of helping. If there is one thing that I can hope come of this is that no one who I know buys an LG appliance. This has been literally the worst customer service experience of my life.",1

It didn't say that on the AMAZON website and the hose can only be 9&#34; off the floor for it to even drain, so you have to let it go into a bucket then pick up the heavy bucket and empty it multiple times per load.  Not practical and too heavy to sit on anything high enough for it to drain. Very bad design. Not easy to use. Would NOT purchase or recommend. Tried to call the company on the paperwork I received more than 21 times in one day and only get a busy signal. Never even get automated machine. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT",1

The OEM unit plastic housing had cracked and was dripping. Unfortunately, all the replacements are plastic too.<br /><br />For such an important part it baffles me that it's not made out of brass or stainless, because even a drip of water over time can cause a lot of damage before its detected.

391342,42,"Took my ice machine apart because I discovered a leak. Insides look real bad so I think it's been leaking the entire time I've had it so about 2yrs. Assumed it was from the ice melting when I would set the ice bucket infront of it to fill my water bottles, my own fault should've looked deeper. I think ive found the issue with a plastic piece being stripped and a screw not being able to help completly seal off water flow. Now I'm trying to contact opal support and it seems as if they've been ignoring my emails for the past week. Will try calling again but the 1st call I was told they'd be messaging me thru email since I had to send the pics and videos of proof. Pics are of damaged insides after I had tried to clean it up.<br />Besides all that it was a decent ice maker. It was kind of noisy so don't expect it to silently sit there a make ice. I didn't mind though it was easy enough to drown out. It is something you have to clean often but the hardest part is just remembering to clean it really haha I don't think this is worth the price if it only lasted for 2 years and if Opal support is ignoring me. I just want help with solutions on how I could fix it without damaging it even more. Read everyone's reviews  before buying.",1

154339,42,"Before getting this, we were pan frying our steaks in non-stick cookware and it just isn't the same.  They were always soggy, soggy, soggy.  I didn't want to go with a cast iron skillet either because it still has the same problem as the non-sitck pan we were using -- the splatter!  This broiler pan was just what we were looking for, since our oven didn't come with one.  Now, at least the mess stays in the oven and cooking most steaks is super-quick: 6-10 minutes most of the time and depending on thickness.<br /><br />Tip:  I found it very difficult to clean off the baked-on fat and juices after broiling beef so close to the flame, especially when you don't have meat covering the whole surface and any juices that aren't covered by meat get really baked on. This happened to me when I had to broil 2 batches of steaks and the second batch was smaller.  To make cleanup easier, place foil over the grill portion, press it down to form into the recesses as best you can, wrap the edges over the sides of the grill 1&#34; or so, then use a butter knife to make slits in the foil where the grill slits are.  This method makes it much easier to clean while still allowing the juices to drain and avoid soggy meat, which is the whole purpose of a grill pan like this.  Note: I don't want to use pan cleaner sprays with heavy chemicals.",5

With this, the water can enter the top and exit almost immediately out of the side, meaning it touches less coffee before exiting the cup.<br /><br />I've seen a few tutorials on how to use an old cup in conjunction with these re-usable ones but it seems like its starting to defeat the purpose of buying this and the convenience factor of the Keurig system. I see a lot of different posts for similar looking re-usable cups. Why can't we have a cup that has a small mesh point at the bottom so it mimics the same process as the regular one time use cups???",1

496510,42,"So far, so good with this icemaker.  It arrived quickly, I plugged it in and waited 30 minutes as the instructions indicated, then poured in the water and turned it on.  It produced ice very quickly, in fact the longer it ran the quicker it seemed to produce the ice.  May have had something to do with the ice accumulating in the bin making the water underneath colder.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I would rather the ice be a little harder when first produced.  But I dump it into a tray in my freezer and it works very well.",4
328744,42,"Easy to install once you watch a YouTube video.<br />My Samsung front load washer stopped draining and the display showed a ""Nd"" (no drain) around the 20 min mark of a cycle. After a Google search and watching some videos I decided to open up the washer. To diagnose the problem, I drained the water and the load finished with a spin cycle. I ran an empty load and it did it again. After another drain I knew I needed to open up the washer. After lots of video watching and 20 screws I took off the washers outside panel with the door so I could look inside and check hoses. I took the hoses off that were connected to the drain pump. Once I saw they were clear I diagnosed the problem as a bad drain pump. I also noted I had the washer for 10 years and that is their life span. Thankfully the part has a part number on it so.<br />I just looked it up. And Amazon had it.  2 days later, it arrived. I already had old drain pump off so all I had to do was connect the new one to the hoses and power source and put the washer front panel back on. Took me much longer to diagnose and take apart the washer than it did to install the new part and reassemble the washer. Works great!",5

No more getting shocked from static electricity all winter long!<br /><br />We were going through a new electric humidifier every other year due to the hard water.

514182,42,"So I bought one after watching many videos, like most people do. All i can say is videos dont do it justice at all. I'm so impressed with this machine. It wont do large loads and honestly if you use it in an rv it uses about 10 gallons of water per each complete cycle (fill 5 gallons drain spin refill 5 gallons rinse spin again). If you are just washing what you wore that day its perfect. We got it to help try to keep up because we are full time rv, it will not only help us keep up but will probably keep us having no dirty clothes at all. It washes very well... super impressive",5

235678,42,"I live in a building with a communal laundry and fellow residents who often didn't wear masks in the building, so I was forced into doing my laundry in my bathtub. After a few months of ringing out clothes by hand, the touch of arthritis in my hands was killing me. I considered getting a fully automatic washer but my tiny bathroom wouldn't accommodate that and it was too heavy to move regularly. The twin tub type didn't seem like it would do enough at once, so I bought this one spinner. It has saved my hands and works well, although not perfect. It is so light, that if it's overstuffed or not balanced, it will go into a frenzy and go flying. You can fit a queen-size sheet in it. Wish a had a permanent place to store this. Has to be set up on an elevated platform for it to drain into the bathtub. Best to layer clothes by putting items in one at a time until it is about half full. I then pour about a quart of water in, spin for 2 minutes, rinse in tub and do final spin for the full 5 minutes, pouring water in through the hose for the first 2 minutes. The gripper feet aren't that great. They leave black marks on surfaces. Wish I had gotten the bigger one for a few more dollars. This has a fairly small capacity.

I chose this over other styles of drippers because I didn't like the idea of using paper filters for each cup of coffee (environmentally wasteful).  So I tinkered with many different grind settings and made sure to scrub the laser cut holes clean.  Yet, every time I brewed, the filter would clog and get backed up.

Each week, we have to spend a few bucks, which may not be a big deal, but in the long run, it will cost a lot. I started to do washing by myself and the drying process was a problem. I tried to remove as much water as possible from clothes by wringing them out, but it was always messy causing the floor wet and clothes were smelly after being wet for overnight. On top of that, it took a longer time than going to the laundry room.<br /><br />I wondered if there is a good compact spin dryer, which I can use in my apartment. I started searching on line and came across this machine. This was quite a new machine, which just came out on the market two weeks ago with no reviews available. There is a smaller version (Nina Soft Spin Dryer) receiving good reviews. I wondered which one to choose and it took a while to decide. In the end I chose this Mega Spin Dryer since I thought it would be more convenient to use a machine with large capacity. It came the next day after I ordered. I have been quite happy to have this machine since it makes it possible to dry our week's laundry in one spin or two. The clothes are dry in 3-4 hours when they are hung on a rack.

I received them in less than 24 hours and now we can dry our cloths again.",5

547525,42,"I'm IMPRESSED! Washes better than commercial washers. This machine actually cleans Better than the commercial washers in our Laundry Room. Sure, I have to do more loads depending on how long I wait to do laundry. The only reason for me to use the laundry room now, is to ""use the dryers"" for my bed linen (sheets and bedspreads). I bought an extra Shower Curtain Rod (to hang clothes hangers) and a ""collapsible clothes drying rack"" for drying my clothes.<br /><br />I calculated my laundry room savings, at $5 per load (wash and dry). This washer will pay for itself in 40 to 45 loads. What a savings deal!<br /><br />I wish I'd thought of this Years ago! This washers came with everything I needed to hook up for use. I just washed 3 full sized commercial loads of laundry in 8 loads with this washer. It's almost silent.<br /><br />I purchased a 20"" x 16"" Furniture Floor Dolly on Amazon, for $25 to put the washer on for easier movement. I keep the washer in the kitchen (much more room) and I roll it into the bathroom for use.<br /><br />This worked out much better than I initially thought it would. I purchased via Amazon Credit, now this is much easier to pay for on my Social Security Retirement Income.<br /><br />Glad I did my research and made this money saving purchase!<br /><br />As I said, I'm Impressed!",5

408256,42,"I was very excited to find this since I love my Bosch Tassimo beverage machine.  I read all the comments and they are pretty spot on.  The bar code that is printed on the silicone lid is not correct and I needed to put a 12 Oz pod on my printer and make copies of the bar code.  This worked fine, but use and washing means you need to replace it frequently.  After a few months, the silicone began to tear around the tab and the flange of the plastic lower cup which is very thin cracked and separated from the body.  I believe this occurred from repeated compression on the flange when you close the pod lid.  The unit is not also too easy to load and you have to be careful to not have coffee grinds on the flange where the silicone lid seals.  For the price and the longevity I'm not sure its worth it.",3

I have to spin dry a million times just to try and dry out a few things. I think it’s good if you’re only doing small loads and don’t mind air drying. It’s also pretty heavy and large and I live in a small space,3

The bestair filter has a layer of wick, followed by metal, followed by a blue layer followed by more wick, as you can see in the photo of the box for a single filter. This filter is just cheap metal with some wick. No layers other than that. I would avoid 'Allergy Be Gone' at all costs for fraudulent selling.",1

491051,42,"When arrived, I was concerned about if it is right part. Online description referred to a different number. Also sticker on the wire says - use only for some specific ignition system. After 20 minutes research found that this thing fits my requirements. Installation was easy. Disconnected power from the oven, cut wires from the old ignitor, replaced with the new one, stripped insulation for about an inch for each wire, connected using two provided nuts, verified the connection if it is tight, since it is an AC circuit there is no reason to care about polarity. First run attempted keeping one hand on the gas valve (just in case). The ignitor gets hot pretty quick and fired up gas furnace momentarily without any smell, pop sounds like it was with the old one. Switched off. Assembled oven. Run again and so far more the 20 times used the oven baking with different temperatures and no suspicious sounds and smells. This thing is doing it's job well. I'm satisfied. Four stars just for the confusing label and no any compatibility specification or list.",4

132341,42,The taste of this water filter is very good and I feel guilty when I give my dog tap water instead sometimes when Im in a hurry. The flavor is absolutely better than the tap in our house. The filter is easy to install as long as you know you don’t need to twist it in place. Make sure to flush 2 gallons as suggested before use as there is definitely a kind of discoloration and debris in the first 1/2 gallon.  The value for money of this product is high in my mind as specially since my refrigerator insists on our need for a new filter every six months. If our refrigerator didn’t look like it was about to go into a nuclear meltdown with all sorts of warnings and countdowns I’d probably only change it once a year based on the ridiculous cost of this fancy plastic tube.,4

However, the doors are crooked and the ice maker spills water in the ice cube bin and makes mini mountains that jam the coiled mechanism that brings the ice to the door. The flap that opens and closes does not close completely and melting ice runs into the tray and down the front of the fridge. This is the first Kenmore appliance I have ever had that was so cheaply constructed. The plastic ice bin had big mini mountain of ice get stuck in it and made a big hole in the bottom on the bin. We cannot afford a repairman right now or even to replace the bin.

Our household has a moderate use for ice, and our icemaker broke on the refrigerator. Instead of buying a bag of ice every other day, I run this for a full day and place the ice in the freezer. It takes about 4 cycles of ice to fill my tray in the freezer (because the output is rather small), but the ice is crisp and refreshing and does not stick to each other. I am happy with this product. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was anticipating it being bigger, but that was just my assumption, and not due to anything on the seller's part.",5

524755,42,"I bought this for my Nescafé Genio (sold here on Amazon), which looks like the Krup KP Genio 2.<br /><br />Included, are two items that I didn't need for use with Solimo ""original"" Nespresso capsules: a smaller inner sleeve/insert, and four adhesive foil seals. I'm guessing that the smaller inner sleeve may be for use with a different style Nespresso capsule. I can only imagine that the foil seals would be useful if you somehow have a ripped or punctured top on one of your Nespresso capsules. I'm not absolutely sure why they provide them, nor do I understand why they'd provide four, and not twenty five, or ten. But, whatever their purpose, you get four of them.<br />[edit]: I suppose these items are included as a way to brew your own coffee (a mini brew basket and seals), but I just don't see that working well, and don't intend to try it.<br /><br />The most noticeable thing about this adapter, is that in my machine, it doesn't sit flush with the front of the machine (see photos) like the original Nescafé tray. After thinking it over for a bit, and of course, not wanting to force anything, I threw caution to the wind, and pulled the handle down and brewed a cup. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it worked perfectly, producing a wonderful cup of coffee (I tried the ""5"" setting using Solimo Espresso Lungo capsules). No spraying water, no explosion of grounds, just a great cup of coffee.<br />So, as I said in this review title, it absolutely works in my machine, and it works well, but you'd never think so just by looking at it.",4
612633,42,"Worked great and would have given 5 stars but the spacers they give you to hold the spring are all but useless.  Putting the spring back is very hard - leave yourself time it will take patience but it is not impossible.  I had to use a clamp to hold one of the spacers in place otherwise it would have flown out and hit me in the face (a couple of close calls before I used the clamp).  The real difference maker was the bicycle tire tools I used (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZGFCE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

423230,42,This filter greatly reduces the mineral deposits or “white powder” that an ultrasonic humidifier puts out as a by product of its operation.,5
360355,42,It is cheap. And I did end up installing it over the home Depot one which was $20 and not $8. But the home Depot version had a wire screen to prevent critters from coming in and did have the foam piece around the lip so it would set better. However we have lots of stray cats in the area so not many small animals venture that close to the ground where my dryer vent is. The real issue I had with this vent was the part that extends was bent so it was not easy to put my vent hose on it. I would have installed the $20 that needed screw holes added had I known how much trouble that was going to be!,3

Both at the bottom and the top of the filter, it became detached from it's frame involving at least 40% of the filter's borders, and just hung.  This rendered the filter completely unuable.  I have had a variety of humidifiers, and therefore their filters, over the years, and this, by far, was the worst longevity and performance I've ever experienced.  Currently I've replaced them with a less expensive non-oem filter, so I will see how they last in comparison.  I would caution the buyer about their poor longevity.",1

The lids pretty much just sit on the top of  the holders with two tabs at the back that kind of hold it in place.

Any idea what the fantastic people at Kenmore (Sears) charges for that piece?  $50 not including shipping. Why? Because they don't sell that specific gasket, I would have to buy the entire assembly.

The ice isn't so soft it breaks a soon as it hits the mouth, but even my dentist is fine with me chewing it because it is much softer than conventional ice. Think hospital ice (for anyone else who has gone through the labor and delivery process). The ice will get smaller and clump together if left in there for too long because ice melts (duh) and sticks together. Just break it up with the scooper that is included and go on with your day. It will also get this way if the tank is filled right at, or over, the line, but it's still delicious. There is very little sound except when the ice falls into the basket, but it's not loud at all.

I do not hand wash my pots and pans and my largest, multi-quart capacity pot fits in both drawers just fine.  I have to use the top drawer for my longer cooking utensils, but even at that, I have laid them down on the side shelves and they get clean all the same.  And speaking of the side shelves, I was worried that since the glasses just sit freely on the shelves that they would fall off.  Not so.  And my glasses come out sparkling and spot/debris free.  In fact, my dishes have never been cleaner.  The machine is easy to use, versatile and I love the ability to run the drawers separately and at different cycle settings.  So I can run a really dirty load on the bottom and a light clean load up top.<br /><br />I have to say, that all the bad reviews caused some concern for me, but I had a professional company install my machine and it has been thrilling me ever since.  Kind of funny to write of a dishwasher thrilling me, especially because I am not a very domesticated, cookie baking type of woman.  But ladies, this is my Ferrari in the kitchen.<br /><br />So, in my humble opinion, the people most likely to write a review are the ones that have a complaint.  No appliance is perfect, but as for me, this is as close as it gets and I will never buy anything else again.

Even soaking wet, items can be put in and spun till they are rung-out so well, that the hang time to fully dry is MUCH SHORTER. This is a great machine and does what it says. Again, it’s not a clothes dryer, but it’s the best way to get your items ready to hang-dry.",5

637129,42,"Bought a 3 pack and couldn't even get past using one. I feel a bit conned by all the positive reviews. Although I read reviewers who had witnessed leaks in their fridge, I figured I take a shot due to the price. This was a big mistake. There's a slow leak with this filter and we didn't realize it until we discovered the pullout tray near the bottom of the fridge was scraping on something. After we pulled it out, there was a sheet of ice underneath. Luckily, it was a slow leak, otherwise it could have been disastrous, especially if you are on vacation. For a bit of time, I thought there was something wrong with the fridge, but it is because of this filter.<br /><br />I'm saddened to say you do get what you pay for. I wish I can get my money back..but didn't notice leak for some time. If it worked out for you, great! If you are like us and wanted to gamble, install and try it out as soon as you purchase it. If there are issues, ask for a refund right away.",1

I needed a dishwasher that would accept, with little modification, a wood panel that matched my kitchen cabinets.  My old Maytag dishwasher died, and I kept the wood panel hoping to find a suitable replacement.  This Whirlpool model fits my wood panel with only a little trimming of the panel; we disassembled the door in order to mount the panel, but otherwise, relatively easy fit.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it is as loud as my old Maytag; you can hear it running from across the street (almost)!",3

154352,42,"UPDATE:<br /><br />You can find my original review below, but after having owned this filter for a while, I would no longer rate it highly. Sure enough, the filter started out great - it worked as well as other, more expensive filters. A few weeks into using it, my fridge now shows the filter to be at 50% of its lifetime and my water has a terrible taste to it. Mind you, the taste that comes out of this filter is MUCH worse than the taste of the water that goes in!<br /><br />In essence, my endeavor is, of course, to remove any and all traces of odor and odd taste from my municipal water supply. This filter, however, manages to make the condition of the water worse.<br /><br />Thus, my verdict: Stay away from this filter!<br /><br />Original Review:<br />There's not much to be said. You can either pay a premium and get a brand-name filter or you can save yourself a ton of money and buy this one. The outcome, as far as the taste of your water is concerned, is the same.<br /><br />I will say that this filter seemed to trap quite a bit of air. After installing it, I had to flush the line until my water dispenser stopped sputtering - since I used a measuring cup, I know that I let about one quart go to waste before my fridge functioned normally again.<br /><br />You should also be aware that this filter comes with a little tube of lubricant that you are supposed to spread on the little O-rings - something I had not encountered before. Doing so took a whopping five seconds and thus, is no problem whatsoever.",1
603764,42,An exact replacement part.  Solved the problem: fan not turning; hot spots on and in the fridge.  Somewhat challenging to install as it is hard to work in the cramped area.  Youtube how-to videos helped.,5

There are a lot of other options but I don't ever use them.  The only thing I have used is the &#34;Steam Refresh&#34; button which adds a little steam to wrinkled clothes which I like.<br /><br />I also do not like the lint filter.  After you pull the filter out of the slot, the empty slot gets a lot of lint down in it that is impossible to get to unless you unscrew the whole thing completely off.  I even bought one of those TV ad vacuum devices to get to places like this and it isn't small enough to get down in there.

668994,42,"I love this (not so) little machine! Just realize that you need to babysit it. The ice basket is not a freezer. Every 7-10 minutes, it produces a handful of cubes. Multitask away; you will hear the cubes when they fall. Dump them in a container and put it in the freezer. Every time you hear a batch drop, take the container out of the freezer and add the new ice. Give a little shake. Return to the freezer. The first two or three batches of ice will be a bit wet and prone to sticking together (thus the shake), but after that, they come out colder and dryer.<br />I make a batch of ice that lasts me a week. The machine has a pretty big footprint so I drain it, dry it,  and put it away when it's not in use.",5
295397,42,"I don't write reviews of a lot of products however I feel it is warranted for this product given the price. I bought this in June of 2022. The product makes excellent ice and is quick as described.<br /><br />However, there are a few things I wish I knew before spending hundreds of dollars on this machine. We wanted an ice maker as we don't have one in our freezer/fridge as most people do, so we wanted ice available all the time. We decided on this countertop unit to have ice all the time.<br /><br />It is very noisy. It started pretty reasonably but as it gets used more it increases quickly over time. Not a deal breaker because the constant ice was a fair tradeoff.<br /><br />It does not keep ice frozen. It will melt and re-make the ice. Therefore, it is a constant cycle of ice-making. Again, not a huge deal because as the ice melts back into the water as ice is being made very frequently.<br /><br />It is impossible to keep clean. See the photo attached. This is after about 10 days. This is because the water reservoir is internal and cannot be easily removed and cleaned as advertised.<br /><br />I reached out to the company and they were responsive but stated the following:<br /><br />""Please note that this unit is not to be kept running for 24 hours. The ice inside the tray when full will melt and keep making ice over and over. This unit is to be used to make ice and then the ice should be stored until the ice is ready to be used. ""<br /><br />This machine is the size of a small microwave. It is heavy. I don't want to spend a whole day making ice, moving it to our normal freezer then clean the machine, move it and store it and get it back out when I need more. Plus, I tried to store the small pellet ice for a later date and it all just freezes into a solid block of ice that can’t be used anyways.<br /><br />Bottle line, if I could go back, I would avoid this product and spend my money on the GE Opal.",1
403237,42,"This product has a pretty serious design flaw. I have seen other people mention leaking problems. Sure enough, mine was leaking instantly once I started it up... dripping from the right edge about half way back.<br /><br />I tracked down the issue, and you can fix this if you are just a little creative.<br /><br />What is comes down to is this: If you look into the lower tank (take out the ice bucket) you will see the drain where water is recycled back to the top to be used again for making ice. That drain has a washer *with almost no pressure applied to it.* In fact it is just a friction fit. Pretty dumb. This could be easily remedied by having a threaded back side and a plastic nut so the washer would compress a little. With all the returns they are dealing with it would be a much more cost-effective solution....but I digress.<br /><br />Anyway, what I did was to slice a synthetic wine cork in half (long ways). Squeeze the cork into the little indentation at the bottom of the reservoir. This puts pressure against the washer but still allows water to move. If you try this, it is at your own risk. Certainly *do not* use a regular wine cork because you will certainly get cork into your water lines. A synthetic cork, sliced cleanly, should be fine, but again... your risk.<br /><br />For now... the leak is solved.<br /><br />On another note, the blue &#34;Ice Full&#34; light was not turning off for me (which means the unit will not make any ice). I investigated the plastic lever that should turn that light (and the ice process) on and off. On the right side of the lever there is a cylindrical housing that probably holds a metal slug or a magnet... something that completes a connection so the circuit board knows the ice bucket is full. Well, my housing was empty. I wrote the company in order to get that part, whatever it is (seems a lot easier than sending the whole unit back). In the meantime I jumped those pins on the circuit board (which of course voids the warranty and should NOT be attempted by most folks, so don't mess around unless you understand what you are doing).<br /><br />So, my ice maker is now working (though I can't leave it unattended or it will jam up with ice cubes... not a big deal for me) and it DOES make clear ice, which is the whole reason I got this unit for my home bar. It baffles me that they are so careless in the design and assembly. I'm sure they are spending far more processing returns than they would if they solved these little issues.",3

371532,42,I had been dealing with ice trays for months after ours stopped producing ice in our Kenmore Elite (in-freezer version). I researched the model and found the ice maker was the same model as this for LG. Two screws and figuring out how to disconnect the wire harness and we were back in business. Longest part of the install was moving the food to coolers and cleaning the stuff that had leaked into the freezer drawers and lower. Now back to producing much more ice than we could manage with ice trays.,5
218800,42,"Wash it before you use it (smelled literally like fish). Do not over pack it. On the whole pretty good. Only used it once so far. Pretty cheap plastic but the suction cups are very strong.<br /><br />Okay, used it again today. Still smells like plastic/fish (even though I washed it out before using it again). No good way to get it all dry inside after using it unless you use a towel (which would then also smell funny). It's very difficult to rinse clothes in there (always seem to have residue), so just rinse them under the tap. I'm not sure how happy I am with this purchase. I love the idea of it, but so far it's not actually that great.<br /><br />Update on 2/9/17: One of the suction cups broke off completely. Still gets the job done.",3

I recommend these very much.",5
212107,42,"First bunch of washes good, but lint starts to become a problem with clothes from prior washes. I cleaned the lint trap and it didnt seem to help. I found that I need to rinse the inside of the drum and visual lint I need to remove by hand. A bra came out completely covered in lint and I waited for it to dry and then wet my hand and rubbed the lint off of the bra. Possibly if the clothes went to a dryer after this the lint would blow into a lint trap, but in hang drying clothes after spin cycle they have lint clung to them. I plan on buying a dryer in the future to help with the lint issue as I believe a dryer with lint trap will remove the lint problem.",4

404094,42,"Loved this filter in the beginning. The first few days were great. I used a 3-4 times a day, cleaning and rinsing immediately after use. Then it started drastically slowing down. I did the vinegar soak. Worked a little better for a day, then bad again. I started having to soak it every night but it didnt really help much.  Then I realized the problem was that the bottom cap of the cone was not adhered tightly. It was wiggly and loose which allowed it to shift around and for the coffee ground to get up between the layers of the mesh filter. I tried pushing the bottom into place before each use. It helped. Then the side seam started to buckle, letting coffee grounds inside the layers through the inside of the filter.  I struggled with it but I was spending so much time and water cleaning this damned thing, I was defeating one of the purposes of having this thing!!!!  I gave up, ordered a different brand and now I am happily sitting and enjoying a cup of hot coffee instead of wasting my time at the sink.",1

227075,42,"Just used the first time, made a really great cup of coffee. Since there are a lot of good reviews, I'll just mention some of my concerns going in:<br /><br />Stability: there seem to be a lot of concerns and warning about the SlickDrip collapsing, as opposed to its rigid competitors. After using it, I really don't see any risk of that if you follow the instructions about how to add water. Also, following those instructions will give you a better tasting cup of coffee anyway.<br /><br />Mess: is all the coffee going to end up in the cup? Will the last few drops attach to the surface and run off the edge? Answer: there is absolutely no residual coffee on the underside of the device. This tells me that every drop that went though the holes ended up in the cup. Although I haven't used them, I'm guessing the rigid plastic drip cups might not perform as well in that.<br /><br />Clean up: with all the nooks and crannies, is this going to be a pain to clean up in non-kitchen environments? Answer: very easy to clean, but air drying is a little slower than a rigid device would be. Not a huge deal, but you may want to plan on drying with a towel.",5

579490,42,"This washer basin is huge - 4.7 holds everything and we have a family of 5.  We almost bought the Kenmore Elite HE5T with steam but found out the regular units are 4.4 but the sale unit only available in ""barolo red"" was only 4.0 - big enough for most but size was our major factor in a new washer.  So we gave up the steam and went with Electrolux.  Electrolux does not make a steam washer, the steam dryer is in the wave touch model ($300 more apiece than the IQ touch).  The main reason to me for steam is stain removal; not so much wrinkle removal, so IQ touch was fine.  Apparently Electrolux and Bosch don't think steam in a washer is necessary; neither offer it.  This washer/dryer is fantastic.  I was concerned about the doors (as many are) but they are incredibly sturdy and you should have no trouble with them, I got used to the 'push' feature immediately.  The tops of the units do scratch - we lined them with the rubber foam liners so we can use the surface area (you can get the wide at Lowe's in the tool section).  Both are very quiet - washer spins so fast you won't believe it.  I was also concerned about the extended wash time with front loaders but with the size of the bin I can almost double my loads.  Also, Electrolux offers an 18 minute fast wash cycle.  Dryer time is incredibly fast because clothes are almost dry when they come out of the washer - 20 minutes for drying in most cases.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/3/11 - I checked back and saw the comments and Electrolux began offering a steam washer shortly after our purchase.  Our Electrolux IQ Touch Washer and Dryer are still going strong and we love them.  No issues whatsoever, and my teenagers do their own laundry all the time.",5

37085,42,"This dryer vent hood is not worth the $5.62. Deflecto brand appears to be mediocre in general. This hood has all the advertised parts and could in theory work to vent a 4"" dryer vent. However, the plastic flap that covers the opening is simply just a plastic flap which is hinged in the cheapest way possible. The flap is not weighted or hinged in such a way that it would stay closed when air is not blowing through it. Once the dryer finishes a cycle of blowing air, the vent flap will just stay open. The result is an active back draft back into the home.<br /><br />Go with a different item. Maybe something by Imperial (also inexpensive but at least works as intended).",2

676380,42,I really love these coffee filters.  We have coffee pots where we are having to buy paper filters and K-cups constantly.  This is the best choice of all.  You can still use your K-cup coffee maker but you can use any ground coffee of your choice.  Sometimes it's hard to find decaf k-cups but it's just not a problem any more!  I use the K-cups more than the drip coffee maker.  To be able to use my favorite grind all the time is going to be a real plus.  The other huge benefit to this is think of how you're saving the environment by not putting all those plastic cups in the landfill every day 24/7.  This is the economical choice as well as environmental.  The construction is a good sturdy blend of metal and plastic.  This is a win/win no matter how you look at it!,5

And now looking at the circuitboard towards what would be back of the fridge tape with scotch tape the chip in the middle of the square on the circuit board. The rfid chip should be taped with the Shiney side towards the board.<br />7. Put it all back together just like ya found it.<br />8. Install this filter<br />9. Your fridge will say over 99 days blah blah blah.  Ignore it.<br />10. Enjoy",5

418701,42,Part was a perfect replacement for my dishwasher. No issues when installing.,4

530134,42,"This thing is great.  And for anyone looking for blowers for Viking or Five Star hoods, this is exactly the same model for less than half the price.  You will need to buy or make the sheet metal cover and cord.  I went and got one from Viking parts because I needed it right away, but cutting a piece of wire and a small square of sheet metal should be easy for anyone who is handy",5
478699,42,"My husband built a hood for me with this vent as a base. Works great, LED lights are bright white, quiet running. We’re very happy with it and it allowed us to build exactly what we wanted!",5
543355,42,Purchased less than a year ago.  It had a lifetime warranty.  It’s lifetime was 11 months.  I ordered the same so I could make this review so I guess It will be lucky to last a year.  Pics show the element just opened without contacting anything and with little lint in the system.  It was inexpensive but you wouldn’t want to pay for the install too frequently.  Took me a couple hours both times.  YouTube is your friend.,2

322798,42,I like to buy loose coffee as well as grind beans but was always unhappy with how weak my coffee was. I was using the less expensive gray one. This is soooo much better. The old one used to let water flow outside the filter and made a mess (not to mention very weak coffee). It took me a while to get used to the cap but now I can do it with my eyes closed. Easy to rinse for daily use and then every so often I throw it in the dishwasher when I run a load.  I didn’t need the extra piece for other Keurig models. Read the directions and you won’t go wrong!,5
455104,42,I was looking for something for my bedroom that was quiet and had a decent size freezer.  It has an okay crisper size drawer and soda dispenser.  I have no complaints.  Nice refrigerator.  No shipping damage.  I've had it for two months now and everything is good and would recommend.,5
228024,42,Strong adhesive so make sure to place exactly where you want it. Downside is it isn’t loud at all. Just a quiet beep that can’t be heard from basement to first floor directly above it. So it doesn’t serve it’s purpose for me,1
558988,42,Great product!  Easy to install and the color blends well with my stove.,5
187895,42,So I'm a woman troubleshooting Ge washer not spinning or agitating also not making the beep beep noise when the lid is open. Forums said lid switch issues. Purchased this lid switch on amazon. Life is rainbows and sunshine again. It was so easy to install. After one YouTube video and some wire snips we were back in business. It took me longer to find electrical tape than the whole install process. Our washer was back up and running in minutes.,5
516181,42,"This piece, along with a simple five minute Youtube video, saved us from buying a new washer. Our five year old washer quit spinning and we assumed it would be either an expensive repair or a new washer.",5

If it’s not replaced quickly, it stops the humidifier from working well. Mine works with filtered city water for only about 4-weeks before turning hard and breaking down.",3
320789,42,The replacements barely fit in the door. They had to be forced. Literally the first time something was placed in the shelf it broke. You think you're saving money by buying these but just buy the Frigidaire replacements.,1

I have had zero problems with it. Now, this isn't an industrial strength tool that can take abuse. You don't want this in a frat house with jocks body slamming each other next to it. The basket is a bit fragile as is the scooper. The plastic interior pieces could easily be broken from misuse. With care, however, this machine can last a long time and produce plenty of ice for a household.",5

54142,42,"Just installed this item in my dishwasher; seems great. Like others have written, instructions are decent but photos are horrible, like they were taken with the world’s very first digital camera!!  First side took me 10 mins to figure out, other side was done in about 45 seconds.  Awww...the simple joy of an upper dishwasher rack that doesn’t randomly fall down!!

628083,42,"Awesome for the cost. Really noticed however that closer to the end of the filters lifetime, the water flow is really restricted. Got about 5 months out of the one before the water was slow that it was only making 1/3 of the ice cubes and took FOREVER to fill a glass of water.",4

42323,42,"I read I breaks easily, so far after 2 weeks and around 10 washes it did an excellent job. I washed my husband's work clothes and they came out very clean.

509463,42,"After You Tubing the problems I ordered the part.  BTW if all the fans in your fridge work and it doesn't get cold i.e. the compressor doesn't work, this part is probably the solution.  Search YouTube for the videos but the most clear symptom of the start device not working is all the other fans work, and there are a bunch of fans in a fridge, but the fridge doesn't get cold. Once you remove the start device from the side of the compressor and find it either rattles or little pieces of electrical waste fall out of it when you shake it.  This kit takes care of everything you will most likely need.  The directions are clear and easy to follow and there are lots of videos to watch as well. Buy it from the Warehouse and save a few bucks.  IN any event before you start taking apart the fridge looking for problems check the start device on the side of the compressor.  It's easy to check and seems to be the number one problem for a warm freezer and fridge.",5

The controls are very easy to operate and have a lot of functions to control what you are cooking from future start to when complete drop temp to keep on just a warm setting.  You'll use the top oven most often for smaller meals as it is faster to heat a smaller space and uses less gas.  Full size oven is on the bottom and can also be run as convection.  Future difficulties would be doing a large turkey, having to lift from the floor level (I haven't done this yet).  Still many features to try, but usage of about 4 months, we are satisfied!",5

For me the symptoms were that the pump would sometimes but not always run.  It was inconsistent.<br /><br />$25 for a repair you can do your self is the way to go.,5

The best part is that it came with a screw that fit my door hinge, so now the door closes perfectly without falling and sagging. I haven't had to tighten the screw and it saved me a trip to the hardware store to find a replacement screw. Thank you.",5

The only difference between these wheel parts and the KitchenAid originals appears to be that the frame that holds the wheels are approximately one inch taller.

Cooled down nicely. Bought this for a bar we built and it is underneath next to a wine fridge.

609852,42,"I really like that I can use this for recipes that typically require you to flip the Aeropress. Since this device holds the water until you press, you can let the coffee steep for as long as you want. I prefer using this to flipping the Aeropress for those recipes. The metal filter works well, but I do get some fine grounds that come through even if I grind at a coarse setting. You can keep out the fine grounds by using a paper filter with the metal filter. If you are concerned with minimizing the amount of paper filters, you can re-use the paper filter multiple times when using with the metal filter, just rinse it off. I find the coffee flavor a little stronger, which I like. And the flavor strength can be adjusted by time steeped and/or the grind used. I have not tried yet, but plan to use for cold brews in the summer. Overall, a good product.",5

Just beware that it may not be exactly the same design as your original machine parts.",4

341495,42,"The metal used in the construction is very thin. While the cooking grate is heavy, the metal stove body is very thin gauge Stainless steel. If you were to drop a metal pot on it is likely to bend. The gas line connector is a hose barb type that a hose slips on and a clamp then secures (not very safe).  The fitting screws onto a plastic pipe inside the stove and uses a negligible plastic or rubber washer for a seal (again not safe). The instructions are completely useless, and have no understandable indication of which orifice valve is installed or for use on propane vs natural gas. And what the hell is unnatural gas as the Chinglish verbiage states???? $160 for this is WAAAAY OVER PRICED for what you get.  A coleman camp stove would be a much better purchase and less expensive. I wonder who is writing these reviews claiming it is so good.  Obviously reviews from a different model than the two burner model I had purchased for my RV installation.

The issue I had was not the i.d. of the seal but the o.d. It was or at the very least appeared to be ever so slightly too large. As a result I would drive the seal, wait a minute, and it would pop back out. After a few try’s it finally stopped popping out and I was able to finish my repair. The washer was as quiet as new for a few weeks. Then the bearings started to make noise again, it is now nearly as loud as it was before the bearing replacement. My suspicion based upon what I found when pulling out the old bearings is that that seal popped out after being replaced and water has damage the bearings again already. I believe this because seal failure was what caused the problem with the OEM components.",3
171910,42,I figured a new washer was inevitable with the leak I had. After some research I found the most likely cause but didn't think I could make the repair. With no such experience I did. Plus despite machine leaking for over a year the old part slid right off and new one slid right on. So for a less than $20 gamble my 15 year old machine will (hopefully) give me another year or two.

Fourth, if you put smaller things in with blankets plan on being around to adjust the them because it wil stop until you arrange the clothes, blankets just right. The dryer also sucks that comes as a combo, it doesn't dry clothes well and blankets could be drying for hours. It also shuts down ,after about 5 minutes, when restarting, (even after it cooled down)trying to dry the clothes thoughly.  Clothes, mostly blankets, end up stinking because they're not dry 3 days later. Better to hang dry. These are worth about $2 but aha they got you to spend $2k or more.",1

BUT we ended up buying a rolling cart which worked out better so it saves counter space. I just assumed it would fit. It cleans amazing and yes our big plates have to be put in on an angle. But hey it beats hand washing dishes. And it uses a lot less water than doing dishes by hand. The only thing to remember don't put plates caked with food. Rinse quick otherwise it could clog the drain. I am so happy with my purchase and my brother will be buying one for his apartment real soon!,5

186442,42,"I'd always wanted one of these countertop ice makers, and when I came across this brand, it seemed ideal for my requirements. I didn't have much counter space in my kitchen for an ice maker, but this one fit perfectly. It was simple to set up and I was up and running in minutes. It began producing ice shortly after and made some noise, but it was not as loud as you would expect from an ice maker. You have to remember that the ones in the fridge are in the fridge, so the fact that it is inside the fridge muffles some of the noise.<br />I needed to run a few batches of ice through the machine because it was new and had that new plastic kind of smell on the ice at first, so I tossed a few batches out to be safe and then tried the ice once I felt it was ready. It was crisp and delicious. I use a lot of ice during the summer, so having the machine make it for me rather than me having to run to the store all the time is extremely convenient. I've been drinking more water and enjoy having this type of ice in my water, so having it on hand allows me to drink more and more water.",5

My igniter appeared to not get hot enough and wasn’t telling the safety valve to open.<br />This igniter was awesome as it came with the appropriate plug. Hardest part of this fix was the 2 screws that held igniter in place.<br />These range in value from 15$ to $150. Not sure how you pick the right one other than matching part numbers. I went for the 55$ version that matched the part on my old igniter. Oven fired right up after easy installation and was a good value for the money. Picture is of repaired oven on first relight.,5

615107,42,"Installed horizontally and based on reading other reviews I added a child safety strap to assure the door stays closed and foam tape for a tight seal between the lint trap and the door. I mounted the unit so when the door opens it swings down so the user doesn't have to keep holding the door open to remove the lint trap. The lint trap itself does feel a bit flimsy and I'm wondering how well it will hold up over numerous heat cycles. I also had to add a strip of aluminum tape to the door hinge on the underside to stop a small airflow escape.  I removed one star for having to add tape, add the child strap, and the durability concern of the lint trap.

Have you considered whether it might be more efficient to siphon water from the toilet to the washing machine or to just throw the washing machine in the bath-tub and shower around it?  Well, then, my friend, this hose just might be for you.  It easily connects to faucet adapters and portable washing machines to allow you to quickly move water from here to there without the buckets, eau de toilet, or the risk of falling and having a washing machine land atop your already-fragile body.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, anymore.

161288,42,[[VIDEOID:c3364d9ea4e3090a18aa4c7f1b795ae6]] I really love my new comfee washer! It really has come in handy! Showed up on time! With no damage! I am so happy with my purchase! No more riding to the laundromat to do my laundry. I'm about to order a dryer from Amazon here shortly and I'll let you know how that works out! But this is definitely one of the Best Buy's I've made this year! I totally recommend it and after searching for a week I found this to be the best value! Especially with the wheels so I can kick it on its back and roll it wherever I want. It also came with all the accessories to hook it up to a sink or two regular washer dryer hookups!,5
682660,42,Exactly what I needed for my reusable K-Cup filter.  These filters make sure that you get a great tasting cup of coffee without any sediment.,5
556229,42,"didn't come close to work in our 2.0<br />gave them to a friend, not sure if it works for him<br />frustrating.",1
124043,42,This is a good product for the price.,5
180960,42,After reading all of the reviews I was kind of worried about the quality of the product but its been OK for the last 2 months. The water taste fine. I guess will just have to wait and see in a month or so.,5
449098,42,So far I'm very happy with this. No problems setting it up (thanks to a little teflon tape). It's the perfect size for one or two people. It makes my life much easier.,5
604000,42,There are so bad it my Nespresso machine can't compress the water through the coffee pod<br />I tried that many times,1
590727,42,"Affordable, easy to use filters. I am really happy with them.",5
518282,42,parts failed as soon as i put them on.  Good thing this wasn't the actual problem on the dryer.  Too cheap to bother with sending back.  Don't bother ordering it.,1
602358,42,"The overall power is very weak, I used it in a bucket which I had to almost fill with water or it splashed everywhere and it had the power only for 1 sock and a cloth, anything more Than that the motor would not turn properly. It’s also a lot bulkier than expected and has a permanent attached electrical wire which has to be connected to use it. I would say it’s a waste of money. It’s gonna cost more in electricity than anything else.",2
396996,42,fast service and a reliable product,5
579214,42,"It's great, basically what I want and need. Thanks.",5
566661,42,"Factory replacements don’t exist so the option is to pay this price, check eBay, or get a new oven.<br /><br />The springs aren’t as strong as the original ones but they work, and hold the door closed. Shipped fast, installation is easy, and if they last 5 years it’ll be worth it.",4
24617,42,I purchased this along with a manual coffee grinder because occasionally my area suffers lengthy (up to 5 days) power outages during the winter and the thing I miss most is fresh hot coffee. Surprise!! It makes better coffee than my electric coffee maker. Just follow the instructions a couple of times and get the hang of it. Very easy to clean.,5
346613,42,"i really enjoy this washer. definitely only for a few items at a time but it is great. the only problem that i saw right off when using, is that when its on the spin cycle sometimes you have to hold the machine still because of how much it wobbles.<br />it serves its purpose though and works pretty good. :)",4
640250,42,We have the K450.  Unfortunately it does not allow you to brew more than 10oz at a time but we can thank Keurig for that idiotic product design.,4
316100,42,In the beginning they were easy to close. The only thing I didn’t like in the beginning was very fine amount of coffee grounds that were on the bottom of my coffee cup. I did not taste them. After two months we only could use one lid because the seal did not allow it to close. We only hand wash them for care.,3
599535,42,Easy to use and effective !!,5
476157,42,These come in handy for when repairing refrigerations,5
202218,42,Makes great ice and I haven't had to clean it ever.,5
279900,42,Buying these in the 3 pack definitely saves me money! Love the value and the ease of installation. We have really hard water so we care changing the filter more than most.,5
6940,42,It just took a few seconds with a small flathead screwdriver popped into the rest of the assembly and worked immediately.,5
595629,42,"saved replacement cost for, I hope another two years",5
93105,42,"Arrived quick, perfect match.  I bought it to go with a replacement pump.  Easy to install.  I recommend it to anyone buying a new pump.",5
74871,42,Not very sturdy.  It's already starting to warp in the dishwasher after only a month.,2
535554,42,It fit perfectly my dishwasher and took much less time than I've expected (about 15 min) to put it in. I spent more time making sure I turned the right switch off on electric box and emptying dishwasher:),5
81747,42,Good product. Keeps the refrigerator smelling good.,5
125865,42,The filter I received is defective. I paid for a service man to tell me I was not getting good water flow and ice because the filter is defective. This item is now ineligible for return. I will be better off paying more locally to a retailer who would take the return on a defective filter.,1
364453,42,I purchased this coffee maker and when I plugged in I got an error message. It said EEO and the book told me to call customer service. Customer service told me to unplug it for about 30 minutes and the problem should resolve itself. It did not. The machine still had the error code. I called Cuisinart back and they were no help at all. Now I have a coffee maker that does not work. Very disappointed with their service.,1
270713,42,This was exactly what I needed to fix the door on my washing machine. Definitely a lot cheaper than buying a new washer! It only took a few seconds to install and has been working great ever since.,5
410388,42,"I really like the fan, but you have to watch the prices here on Amazon! They are asking $1149 for a discontinued model while I paid $789 from my local appliance store. Just want to save you from a major rip-off.",4
10496,42,We received our countertop ice maker in 6 days from the date of our order.  It arrived in perfect condition and we are very happy with this machine.  It is working perfectly and gives us ice in 6-7 minutes.  We are looking forward to using this in our small camper that has a small refrigerator without an ice maker.,5
373612,42,"Just like OEM, easy to install, water taste great. Ice cubes come clear.",5
255569,42,"This works fine on my LG washer model WM2101HW.  The local parts place wanted $100 to replace both the broken plastic spline and the magnetic casing even though these clearly are separate parts and there was nothing wrong with the casing.  The original part came with a plastic spline that wore out preventing the drum from rotating.  This part is mostly plastic but has a metal spline built into it.  In the end, this may just shift the failure point to a different location but overall, it looks much better designed.  Ideally, it would be better if this were made completely of metal.<br /><br />Installation is fairly simple but getting enough torque on the bolt that holds the part on can be tricky since the drum rotates as you tighten it down.  It took two people with one holding the drum in place and the other tightening the bolt.  I don't know an exact torque value but several years ago, the factory tightened drum loosened itself which likely did a great deal of the damage to the original spline.  I made sure this was pretty tight.<br /><br />My only issue with this order was with delivery.  It took a long time to ship and even longer after my credit card had to be cancelled a few days after my original order.  It really shouldn't take 11 days to get a part this small - especially one that is critical for the functioning of a major appliance.",4
266242,42,"We use these covers in the summer to push more air through our vents to our upstairs. We did cut them to fit the size of the vents we wanted to cover and haven't had any problems. Some reviews stated they fall off easily - the only time ours have fallen off our vents are when they are pulled off (we have young children) or knocked off.<br />Our half bath on the lower level of our house tends to get very, very cold while using the A/C during the summer (even with closing the vent). These have been absolutely wonderful to block the air that still pushed through.<br />After seeing the difference in our house, my father bought a few packs for his house. While the upstairs may be comfortable for them, the downstairs was always too cold. Some of their vents are even on the ceiling. He, too, has had great results. It's not as cold, and even using them on the vents on the ceiling, he has not had any fall off (he did cut them down to the size he needed to cover the vent as well).<br />This price is a great price and I'd suggest these to anyone that would like to keep cold or warm air from coming out of certain vents in their house!",4
501151,42,It seems to last a tad longer than the name brands.,5

194750,42,"Poor design, basically they use a tongue and groove design between the scoop and the pour top. For some odd reason they put the groove on the scoop side. When you scoop the coffee it fills the groove not allowing the top to seal properly.",1

562704,42,"I recieved parts at the original time and in good condition, easily installed and worked perfect",5
433268,42,"Works like a Champ!,  BUT!!! Something went wrong.  At first I thought it was the water pump.  No big deal, after 2 requests to customer service and then a 3rd follow up, &#34;Where is the Pump&#34; they sent one out.  It was very easy to replace, but did not fix the problem.  So now I have sent 3 requests to ask what's my next option.  NO RESPONSE nothing,<br /><br />Ill buy another model, just not this one.  It really did work well, but the Customer Service doesn't.",3
157386,42,The water pump arrived as described and in a timely manner. I was so glad to be able to fix my washer for such a little amount of money :),5

43774,42,"So much pressure loss. The water is just over a trickle, swapped out the first with another, and same issue.",2
675983,42,"Disappointing - small quantities of Ice is made fairly fast, as advertised, and this little thing will make ice all day long as long as you feed it water.  Well-made and works very well ion that sense.  My problem is this: the holding tray is not refrigerated.  As the wet ice drops into the basket, it actually starts to melt.  This is no big deal if you are going straight from the basket into a glass during a social gathering, but if you are trying to make ice and move it to your freezer for later use, it doesn't work out.  I have a Meile refrigerator freezer with an ice maker that has just never worked right in spite of filter changes, service calls, etc;  First refrigerator I have ever owned that can't make ice properly but I guess that's too much to expect from a fridge that costs 3x more than any other I've ever owned.  Anyway, when I dump ice from this little guy into the ice holding tray of the Meile, I just end up with a brick of ice cubes 2 hours later and need an ice pick to whack off enough to just fill a glass.  The good part is the 4 dogs are consistently happy with the ice that ends up all over the floor whenever I do that...",3
196926,42,"So far so good as far as freezing food and ice, but very disappointed in how the product was delivered.  I don’t know if it was enroute while being shipped or if it was the movement on the shipment van to my house, but there are several dents on the bottom sides of this fridge.  It seems to work fine so far but I am quite upset that the item is athletically damaged (again this is only the first day of use).  If it appears that the item is not going to function properly, I will update my review.  I did buy the warranty associated with this product as well.",4

433459,42,"K-cups are convenient and allow for making cups of coffee anytime, but they are usually expensive and wasteful. These are almost as convenient and much more ecologically responsible - and they save money. If you like stronger coffee, like I do, you will need to use them with filters (which you can get on Amazon). I grind coffee in the morning finer than recommended (I use 3 on a burr grinder) and pack it a bit by tapping the screen cup with filter and coffee on the counter top. You can get a good 10 ounce cup this way. The cups rinse easily if you don't let them dry out for too long with coffee in them.",5
316205,42,"Excellent product, good price but they took their sweet time shipping it. Advertised that it would ship same day if ordered by a certain time of day but they waited a week before they shipped and it went via UPS who delayed it longer than their normal one week delivery time for some reason, all the while we had no way to dry clothes. I would have given 5 stars for the product but the shipping left a bad taste in my mouth. =(",3

159281,42,This washer is EXCELLENT when used properly. (fits a good amount too) plus cleaning the filter is easy as cake.<br /><br /> •Noise level? More of a hum. (Great!)<br /><br /> •Size? Countertop height for me. (Perfect)<br /><br /> •Cleanliness of clothes? 10/10 just don't compact the clothes in the washer!!<br /><br />The •ONLY• issues I had have easy fixes.<br /><br />  #1 -maneuverability without buying another product.- The product scuffed my floor so I HIGHLY recommend putting cardboard from the box under it. That fixed that issue easily. Now I can even just slide the machine with 1 foot. (on hard flooring)<br /><br />  #2 -Drain hose pops out of the sink.-<br />I just put something to hold it down and fixed that issue.<br /><br />  #3 -When cleaning *the machine* (as recommended) the bottom screw drain hose area has little room to drain the water.- Easy fix is to use a larger baking sheet to catch the water to clean that piece.<br /><br />***<br />The only thing that could be improved about this product is the packaging for shipment. I would recommend this product to those in the market for a new washer that's in smaller proportion. •Worth the $$•<br />***,5

The entire unit was cheaper than most sites wanted for some of those specific parts.

322753,42,"My dryer run is 34'.  I bought 3 kits.  It was actually cheaper to buy 3 kits, than to buy extensions to reach 34'.  The length worked out just about perfect as the poles aren't always geometry straight when they're going thru the vent, so I needed every single extension rod (36' total) to clean a 34' duct.  As others have stated:  NEVER run the drill in reverse (counter clockwise), you will unscrew the connections and you will inaccessibly strand your rods and brush inside the vent.  I duct taped each extension connection point, but I don't think that's really necessary.  It will buy you a couple seconds of insurance in case you accidentally reverse the drill.  Probably smarter to just duct tape the fwd/rev button on your drill in the fwd position.  I put my drill on low speed which is plenty of rotation, in my opinion.  I tried it on fast speed and I seemed to have a harder time unscrewing the connections when finished.  I think fast speed way overtightens the connection points.  I cleaned from the vent exit point, going &#34;upstream&#34; a foot or two at a time, then reversing (not reversing the drill, that's always fwd/clockwise, but pulling out the brush to clear lint), while the dryer was running on 'no heat' setting.  That way the airflow pushes out what you loosen up, a little bit at a time.  If your vent is already plugged, this method probably isn't the best way to go.  All I can say is I got A LOT more lint out than I expected.  Two regular size Target bags, filled to the handles, full of lint and hair too.  That was one of the biggest surprises, how much hair came out.  Gross.  Can comfortably say that the dryer vent is completely clean now and done for half the price of a professional cleaning after a single use.  Plan on using it again every year.  If I had any critique it's the time it take to screw/unscrew each connection.  Not a big deal if you have a 10' run, but mine is a very long dryer vent run.  However, some kind of quick-connect would probably drive the price up too much.",5

Then it began turning the power to the Refrigerator on and off REPEATEDLY every 3 minutes.  The yellow light would come on, then the green light, then power lost.

They are easy to fill and empty out. I use paper filters with them, so I simply pull out the paper filter, dispose of it and the unit is ready to be used again. I like having 4 of them because I can fill all four at once and I am good to go for awhile. Good product at a great price.",5

I have a super small freezer, but lots of people in my home. It does make some noise when it’s filling up with water and as the ice is freezing. But that is because it’s doing it’s job.  I know some people may not like the different sounds it makes, including when it is scraping the ice off the shelf and putting it in the basket. But any refrigerator/freezer icemaker would make the same sound.  I do wish it had something on the side or someplace to actually put the scoop.

336595,42,"This is our third induction cooktop (keep selling the houses after the kitchen gets remodeled).  We've had Bosch and LG previously with fantastic performance.  We liked that this one came with a pan that fits across the two bridge burners and the style of the controls.  The fact that there is a built-in timer that's easy to use is awesome.  But the performance just isn't there.  We were used to having powerboil settings that brought a cup of water to boiling in ~2 minutes, this one (regardless of the burner) takes significantly more time.  Additionally the induction elements don't disperse well around the pan as well as both previous manufacturers had, it seems the outline is much more of a guideline than anywhere close to the actual induction coil size (as evidenced by where water or oil boils on the bottom of the pans when in use).  Controls can be a little finicky too but it's nice to use a finger on the round part or the + / - buttons to tweak settings.  Also this thing requires a 50Amp circuit per the instructions, well we're not rewiring to 6 gauge wire from the existing 8 so I guess we'll see how it does on a 40A (keep in mind this in no way limits the power output of the burners just means we can't use all five at the same time).  Overall wish we had stuck with a Bosch or the LG studio series we previously had that featured much more powerful settings, more uniform heating, and still had the bridge burner functionality.",3

172155,42,My dishwasher (KDTE104DSS0) wasnt on the list but these worked perfect.  I hate the bottom rack on this thing and broke a wheel off manhandling it.  These new ones have the metal retainer so I think they will stand up to my abuse.  I really only needed one set of wheels but replaces them all since I got a complete set.  I discovered the other side was missing a wheel too - probably why I had to manhandle the darn thing al the time.,5
516462,42,"This works exactly as intended.  We always tried to keep the door slightly open when not in use, but many times the door either ends up closed anyway, or swings open blocking the whole laundry room.  This little device works wonders to keep it open just enough to avoid damp smells, while also avoiding a wide open door.<br /><br />Two caveats to be aware:  1) due to the angle sometimes it's tricky for the magnet to grab the door, but I have not found this to be a major issue, once you get the hang of it it just works.  2) when washing a load, you do need to remove the device and store it somewhere (we attach it to the washer so we remember to but it back).  This was originally not clear to me and became evident once I installed it for the first time.<br /><br />It would have been great to have a device that does not need removal, but until that becomes available, this is the next best thing.

The company that sold the replacement part never replied but Whynter customer service replied asap and assisted me in the purchase and tracking.

1790,42,"[[VIDEOID:mo3PN7CE2P74JSQ]]I recently traveled to Uganda (East African country) in October 2013. I had purchased this machine years ago for my own use and loved it. So I took it to a friend of mine who is a missionary in Africa for her to use. We both work as volunteers for a health care organization called Kissito.org. Kissito works with villagers in Africa to bring health and maternity care to villagers. So we demonstrated the washer to them after learning that the girls in African families must do all the family laundry each day before going to school. If they don't finish the laundry, they must miss school. Hoping to show the families something that could help them do their laundry well, and do it quickly, we took the machine into the villages. This video clip is one of a local villager who transports patients to the local health clinic demonstrating the machine to a group, including teasing a boy who is trying to turn the handle. This is the machine in action!<br /><br />What I love about this machine is it is pretty sturdy, since it withstood a year of my daily use, plus it survived 500 African villagers cranking on it all in ONE day!<br /><br />If you thought red Georgia clay was hard to get out of clothes, you haven't been to Uganda, east Africa.  These villages have no electricity, no paved roads, lots of kids (average family has 7 children) and lots of dirty clothes. Families there LIVE in dirt huts, farm, play, work and have the dirtiest clothes imaginable, yet the WonderWash got load after load of clay and dirt soiled clothing CLEAN! The villagers were amazed, as was I.<br /><br />I mean after all, my gym stains and smelly, lightly dirty clothes I expected to get clean, but the grime and dirt that rinsed out of the WonderWash when put to a REAL test was stunning. It was SO effective our organization is trying to find a way to get MORE machines to Africa. Why? Because the girls in each family are tasked with washing the family's clothes every morning before leaving for school. If they don't finish the laundry, they must MISS school to do so. WonderWash could CHANGE the world simply by providing the ability to wash clothes fast enough that these girls can do the laundry and get to school on time.<br /><br />WHY WONDER WASH ROCKS<br />It's lightweight, yet sturdy. I mean, after all it stood up to the rigors of a hike and trip in the back of an SUV on really rocky, difficult roads to get to an African village! It traveled TO Africa in a plastic tub packed with medical supplies, and survived the airline's handling without a crack or scratch!<br /><br />It is easy to assemble.<br /><br />It's durable. More than 500 villagers each had a chance to crank on the handle over the period of ONE DAY as we moved into three separate villages and demonstrated the machine with clothes the villagers brought to us. Kids, men and women of all ages and strengths gave it their best and it kept on working!<br /><br />It cleans! At one village we received a pair of pants a toddler had soiled himself in, a bloody towel from a health clinic, a pair of men's pants used by a man herding cattle and soiled with manure, and several very delicate, beautiful and colorful women's dresses, plus a large scarf. We washed them ALL in one load and they ALL came out CLEAN! Plus, they smelled GREAT!<br /><br />I can't say enough GOOD about this machine. I used it in the USA for a year until I got a car and could go to the laundromat where there was also a dryer. The only thing NOT to like about this washing machine is you do have to wring the clothes out and hang them up to dry...not a big deal. It works and for the price there's nothing better! I love it!",5

379473,42,"Yeah! It's just a round sponge. ONE only!  $14.99 for a sponge? Get real!<br />We have had a Shark for almost 3 years. The vacuum machine is very convenient -- so convenient that we bought a 2nd and 3rd one for our 2 sons when they went out on their own.<br />Just take the filter out of your machine and rinse it under some cold water, squeeze it, rinse it and squeeze it again. Repeat until the water runs out of it clear. Set it out and let it dry. Re-install when it's dry, and you're ready to go again.<br />$14.99 for a sponge is ridiculous. Don't do it. If there were 6 in a pack, well, maybe. Cost would be about $3.00 each, plus shipping.  That would be a life-time supply.<br />(By the way, Shark offers packs of 3 directly.

352680,42,Considering the price you pay for these they should at least go longer without having major issues.<br /><br />The parts used are crap. The problem is that they look good on the outside but what's inside where you find your problems. When your belt does break after a few years you'll no doubt wonder why they couldn't have used better quality.<br />The stench that will eventually come from your washer makes you wonder how you went 15 years with an old style one that didn't ever have that problem.<br /><br />Move on to a better brand and a better product. Samsung...just stick with the tv's and other gadgets.,2

67493,42,"The product was rather easy to install however I needed the 1.25"" wheels and this set came with the smaller .9"" wheels. No real problem as I was able to remove the smaller wheels from the new adjusters and assemble the inside part of the roller/wheel with the old 1.25"" wheels - you need a bit of force to push the inside part into the old wheel but it'll fit. Make sure the tab on the wheel assembly fits back into it's slot before tightening the screw that holds the wheel onto the metal adjuster. The instructions are OK but do yourself a favor and watch one of the many YouTube videos on how to remove the old adjusters and put these new metal adjusters onto the upper rack. Also - most videos say you need a T-15 torx screw driver - my kit came with T-20 torx screws so best to have both available! Note to seller - PLEASE INDICATE THE WHEEL SIZE IN YOUR DESCRIPTION!!!",4

396033,42,"I like it and it performs as advertised but be aware of what it really does. It is not like making ice in your freezer. The unit only cools when it is making ice. The cubes drop into an ice bucket and at that point it's not much different from a cooler. Gradually the ice melts and the water is returned to the reservoir. Eventually the machine will refill the ice bucket when the cubes at the bottom have melted down enough that there is room for more ice to go in at the top. Also, the ice that comes out of your freezer will probably be around 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The ice out of this ice maker is not as cold and won't have as much cooling as ice out of your freezer.",4

534090,42,Works great. Easy to install. Heats up food efficiently. In some cases too efficiently... but that may be operator error.,5
83005,42,"I'm glad I read the other reviews before buying. I gave GE a call at the number shown on original 2006 memo ( 800-694-8477 ) and after a very brief wait was connected directly to a service tech. He was very helpful and the discussion was breif - as one should expect with an issue as well-known as this. I did get the expected run around / side-stepping to avoid replacing mine for free. But to save time and personal aggravation I chose to simply accept their terms of 50 plus tax, which included the cost of next day shipping. Since I was already prepared to pay twice that and wait twice as long if I purchased it here on Amazon, I was happy. If you're feeling argumentative and righteous you can probably get it for less or even for free, as many others have stated here. Just FYI, he told me they had about 36,000 of these boards in stock, ready to ship. So really, why pay 100+ here when you can easily get it for half that directly from the manufacturer?",5
689517,42,Works just fine on my S340 Elite. I wish the magnets were stronger but they work fine.,4

131854,42,This product works as advertised. It is just a tube that attaches to your vacuum. It fits very well in my Samsung Upright dryer. I removed 6 years worth of lint that felt soo satisfying. Product is great quality and very cheap. I highly recommend this to everyone!,5
646201,42,Best idea in the world<br />No need to do anything but slide it on and it will suction to whatever.,5
451130,42,"The good:<br />* Fits precisely over the top fan grill.<br />* Very fine mesh.<br /><br />The less good:<br />* Glossy plastic frame clashes with the S340's matte finish, as do the curved edges.<br />* Corners rise up a little. As far as I can tell there's no gaps, but from where I sit, it always looks like it's peeling back just a little. I think this is just a side effect of the fan screws underneath being a hair taller and pushing the corners up.<br />* Nearly $20 shipped.<br /><br />Since the S340 has a groove all around the top fan grill, it would be great if the frame could've been designed to drop into place instead of sit on top. A more flush to the top of the case profile and better matching design would've made it an instant recommendation. As is, I'd say it depends on how dusty your room is.",4
229072,42,"I'll have to shave a few millimeters of to make it fit without rubbing the dryer door. I'm not sure exactly what part yet needs to be trimmed. This company also seems to disregard others who have made the same complaint, telling them they must have ordered the wrong part.",1

161352,42,Replaced an identical hood that was about 25 years old from the same manufacturer.  The new one is substantially lower quality than the old one but I guess that’s no surprise. The metal is fairly thin gauge and wasn’t significantly damaged but a little bent up from Shipping.  But what can you expect for the price?,3
153709,42,I like the look. with that said the regulator fell apart installing it. I had to order a second unit to get another regulator which also did not work. I bought a regulator from els-ware. I sent back the second one with all the parts that I did not need.,2
273,42,"I have a 10-cup Bonavita which uses flat-bottomed filters (as opposed to the v-shaped ones) and I've been using Bunn 10-cup filters for years. The Bunn filters had to be sort of shaped to fit correctly as they were really too large.  I know that Melita filters are supposed to be very good, but I was never willing to pay for them as the Bunn ones seemed fine.<br /><br />However, I suddenly saw this pack of 1200 Melita filters for the exact price (1.6 cents each, in large quantity) as the Bunn and tried them, and they are great.  Why? Because they not only fit perfectly (without shaping, just drop them in the holder) but are a very delicate paper. I have read that using paper (rather than a gold mesh filter) blocks out some of the ""coffee is bad for you"" things, and I like the lack of any sediment when using paper filters. But I like that the Melita are so delicate that they work and are so easy to use.",5

250838,42,These filters look exactly like the originals that came in our fridge but they don't fit right. I had to press EXTREMELY hard to make it stay in place and even then I wasn't sure it was going to stay attached because the side clips are a fraction too long. The one I put in seems to be staying put so I'll use the 4 pack I bought but I won't get them from this source again.,2
141547,42,"I bought these bags to replace my cold brew coffee pitcher. I wanted to make bigger batches of coffee so I wasn’t making cold brew every other day. With these bags and an enormous mason jar, I’m able to make about 6.5 cups of cold brew. I use ~115g of coffee per batch, though the bags easily hold 125g or more. The material is very easy to clean and coarse ground coffee is contained inside the bag. There is a small amount of fine sediment at the bottom of my cold brew jar, but that’s to be expected and it’s never enough to get into my coffee. The drawstrings may not last forever, but those are easy to replace and I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with these bags and I would recommend them to anyone looking to stock up on tea or cold brew.",5

138713,42,"I bought this after knocking over the AeroPress a couple of time using the inverted method. The mess is just what you would imagine with grounds and coffee everywhere. I used the inverted methods because I like to stir longer to help maximize the extraction without most of the coffee dripping out as it does when putting the AeroPress in the upright position. This attachment gives me the best of both methods and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />BTW, the permanent filter works well by itself with very little if any sediment ending up in the mug. However, I still use a filter paper with it because the paper absorbs most of the cafestrol, which is a saturated fat in coffee that gram for gram has been found to raise cholesterol level more than another type of saturated fat. With the amount of coffee that I drink my doctor recommended I stop using my beloved French press and move to filtered coffee (she also recommended I cut back on the amount of coffee I drink, but fat chance of that) as part of a set of other changes to my diet, namely switching to a whole food, plant based diet, to lower my cholesterol so that I could avoid having to take a statin. With such a major change in diet, it's hard to tell how much of a difference switching to filtered coffee made to the drop in my total cholesterol from 210-220 to 140 and LDL from 150 to 90. But it turns out I like the less bitter flavor with the paper filter.<br /><br />One note of caution, when using a paper filter you still have to use the metal microfilter with the paper filter on top. I forgot once and with only the edges of the filter gripped between the cap and the cylinder  and nothing under it to support it, as soon as I started to press the filter paper pulled out and ended up as a lump in the valve cap. Coffee would only come out when the paper wasn't covering the valve, but then the grounds came out as well. And when the lump of paper covered the valve nothing would come out.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing, despite what Fellows might imply, the pressure during the press is far too low to make anything like the crema one gets from a high pressure espresso machine. Instead what you get is a thin jet of coffee coming out of the center valve at a good velocity. This entrains some air as it goes into the coffee already in the mug. This causes some small amount of froth. But making the AeroPress into an espresso maker isn't why I bought this, so this little bit of exaggeration doesn't bother me.",5

The ones purchased in 2015 had both NSF 42 & 53 certification on the box.<br />2.

Sometime between 11/2015 and 12/2016 they changed the product, changed the box, or the product is the same but failed subsequent NSF 53 certification by an independent agency.

If we pull out and  check the line every week or so. How many people do that?!  And what else isn't covered in the extended warranty?

183587,42,"Dishes are my nemesis.  No, I really hate doing the dishes by hand.  I had forgotten how life was without a dishwasher until I moved to NYC last year.  Got a great old loft but no dishwasher.  I wrestled for a year with a sink perpetually half full of dishes, until a friend suggested I get one of these counter top dishwashers.  After doing some research, I ended up with this Koldfront one.  Mostly because it was black, matched my kitchen, and didn't look all cheesy.  It's changed my life.  I've used it extensively for about 4 months now and have had zero issues.  There's a dual tube that runs out the back and hooks up to your kitchen sink.  You screw a little nozzle into your sink and the tubes just clip on when it's dishes time.  I coil the tubes behind the unit when it's not in use, so it kind of just looks like a big microwave.  Doesn't hold enough for a family, but for a single person or a couple it's great.  Even disregarding the loading instructions, I stack it full however and run it and things turn out great.<br /><br />Pretty quiet, no louder than a regular dishwasher.  Takes about 45 minutes on the P3 rapid cycle -- only one I ever use.  It's also more environmentally friendly than doing the dishes by hand, and is light on the power consumption.<br /><br />Main weakness is the drying -- it's not as effective as a regular dishwasher, and will leave some sitting water on the bottom of coffee mugs, etc.  Venting isn't great, I usually crack the door open after the drying cycle is done to help air everything out and let the moisture out.<br /><br />Make sure you have the counter space, it's about 19"" deep and 17"" high.  I love this thing.  Great appliance if you don't have a regular dishwasher.",5

369838,42,"Once in a while you come across a device that works as described.  This adapter is one of those!  It’s quite ingenious, Shark Tank worthy!  We just moved into a new home.  The builder installed one of those new flush mount recessed dryer vents.  I thought it was great until I realized the vent tube was oval.  What to do?  I tried to conform the aluminum flex hose, but I couldn’t get it to fit the oval.  I picked up a plastic adapter at Lowes, but it was an elbow that required another aluminum male adapter to attach the flex hose.  It defeated the purpose by pushing the attachment 4” beyond the wall.  I did get it all installed, dryer ran fine, but there had to be a better way.  That’s when I found this simple yet effective device.  It slid into the oval perfectly, then the other half threaded tightly onto the flex hose.  Amazing!  Snap the 2 halves together,  and done!  I slid the dryer back in place and the flex hose slack seated nicely into the flush mount recess.  I gained about 3 inches of space which is important for a small laundry room like ours.  Bravo to the genius that designed this adapter!!",5

First of all, they fit right into our spice rack, which is right next to our coffee maker, so for us, easy to store. The purple color is attractive. They fit right in to our single cup adapter. The bottom is raised so the pin that pierces the Keurig pods is not a problem. Works very well, and might buy more. Will have to see how long they last.",5

I bought this one mainly because of price. It was the next cheapest after the sunbeam. I paid about $220 with prime. This is smaller than half the size of a regular washer so I believe the price is right. I hope to get many years out of this. Will update if anything goes wrong.,5

I have been in contact with the manufacturer, to little avail.  They sent one control panel for replacement whereas the hood has two control panels.  The plug on the lead on the original panel has a male end and the connection to the hood is female, the one they sent has two leads and it has a female end, it will not connect.  Beside what do I do with the extra lead?  The new circuit board is missing a piece when compared to the original one.  It has been 3 months and still not working.  I do not recommend.",1

555050,42,"I ordered this fan for my GE French Door refrigerator after noticing that the area where the bottom of the refrigerator doors and the top of the freezer door make contact with the unit housing was becoming very hot to the touch. That symptom indicates a bad coil fan.<br />Even though it was supposed to be compatable it wasn't. However a fairly simple modification made it work anyway. The new fan looks like a basic computer case fan; square in shape with four mounting holes at the corners. Unfortunately with my existing fan housing the fan is incorporated into the fan shroud making it all one piece. I used an oscillating tool to cut away the old fan from the shroud leaving a nice flat surface on which to mount the new fan to the shroud. I used four 1 1/2"" 8-32 machine bolts, four lock washers and four 8-32 wing nuts to mount the new fan and wing nuts to the OUTSIDE (the side away from the coil and toward the compressor) of the shroud. I sealed the fan using aluminum metal duct sealing tape. The two connection wiring harness fit perfectly. Be sure to give that coil a good cleaning after removing the shroud while you have access to it!<br />(TIP! be sure to unplug your old fan and connect your new fan before you remove anything but the rear access cover to your fridge. Verify that your old fan ISN'T WORKING before ordering a replacement and the new fan DOES work before going any further with the installation. Thankfully there are several handy YouTube videos that show how to do this job in great detail. With the units where the shroud and fan are one piece, like mine, the job more complicated because you have to remove a bracket that holds the end of the coil opposite the shroud end in  place so that the coil can be re-positioned to allow for removal of the shroud but it's not that difficult to do.)<br />My fridge now works perfectly again!<br />Good luck with your project!",4
673478,42,Excellent buy. These filters work great. Sometimes you find yourself with two filters instead of one and you have to pinch it a bit to separate. That's because they're very sheer and allow the coffee to filter through wonderfully. Best quality filters I've ever used!,5

Then removed the actuator by removing the plastic cover that had two hex head screws and two Phillips screws holding the actuator and a muti pin plug.

Here’s what I did***: Turn off circuit breaker for oven, remove racks, remove two screws in element mounting plate, pull out element through the white insulation in the hole just a few inches until you see the two wires attached to the prongs on the old element, carefully slide off the wire connectors from prongs, remove element, slip on the same wire connectors to prongs on new element and double check they’re securely slid all the way down, slide wires and element ends back in the hole, replace screws through mounting plate attached to new element so it’s flush with the back of the oven, replace racks, turn power back on at the circuit breaker, and your done!  Recommend running your oven at 400F for 20 minutes after installation with an exhaust fan on or a window open as there’s some burning smell that is normal for new heating elements when first fired up.  Hope this helps anyone who was in the same situation as me.<br /><br />***dont hesitate to call a qualified professional if necessary.

46559,42,The original 9 year old GE profile Microwave grille finally failed to close.  The plastic holding the return springs finally broke.  This replacement matched the exterior of the microwave perfectly.  Internally there were some differences.  The original grille had the two top mounting screws going into threaded plastic where the new one had metal u-clip nuts.  Improvement but with a problem.  Explained below.  The second difference is along the bottom of the new grille there where four plastic tabs that the original looked like should have been there but were snipped off.  These four tabs fit into four mounting slots on the Microwave.  The idea is you align the tabs with the MW slots slightly to the left and when fully inserted push the grille to the right locking the grille in place.  Seems a better grille fit solution but in doing the slide right part the screw nut u-clips became miss-aligned.  Now the screws only go in to non threaded holes.  I chose to leave it like this as the grille seemed attached solid and the opening and closing function worked perfectly.  I could have sheared off the four tabs and installed the new grille similar to the original but the tabs certainly made a difference in the overall fit of the unit.,4

It seems to work fine.<br />The seller and the product are not to blame for my unhappy experience, so I had no choice but to leave a 5 star rating. Wish there was an N/A category so you could leave a comment without rating.<br />What I learned is that this hi-capacity range hood is not for everybody, in fact it’s not right for most people. Do your homework before you buy.",5

164769,42,"I should have done more research before ordering this product.  I bought this as a replacement bulb for my Conair makeup mirror based on reviews that said it was a good replacement for the bottom white bulbs.  These bulbs do fit as they have the right socket (E12).  But they are a very dim warm light.  Not good at all for this application.  Unfortunately I am beyond my return window now as I just tried to use deal with it.  I just ordered E12 replacement LED bulbs that are 6000K and 650LM, a nice bright cool light.  The LED should work without exceeding the max wattage of the makeup mirror.  If you need replacement bulbs for the Conair makeup mirrors, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!  Look into the LED equivalent bulbs instead.",2

579749,42,"I purchased this after I was gifted a Keurig during Christmas. Keurig cups are expensive, plus I consider them pretty wasteful.<br />I was (and still am) pretty happy with this product. It is very easy to use and easy to clean. You simply fill the cup with the ground coffee of your choice, then stick in the Keurig like you would a regular K-Cup. Run the Keurig cycle like you normally would... and you've got a good cup of coffee within 3 minutes.<br />My only complaint is that - over time, the top is more difficult to close and seal correctly. This has unfortunately resulted in coffee grounds getting in some of my cups of coffee. But I have owned the same one for over a year, so it lasted quite a while before starting to do that. And now I double check the top to make sure it is sealed before brewing my coffee. It still works well - it just requires me to take an extra step I didn't have to do before. I am still satisfied with this product and the fact that it allows me to safe money and have less trash waste.<br />Thanks!",4

But what made it even worse the door was broken off the hinge.<br /><br />I plugged it up and as you guessed it... NOTHING HAPPENED. It wouldn't even come on.<br /><br />I was super disappointed because the refrigerator was super cute and it would have went perfect in my husband mancave.<br /><br />I contacted amazon and was able to return the item with absolutely no problem.

211002,42,I have a very old side by side refrigerator and the ice maker finally quit. I replaced it with the Snap. It makes smaller ice cubes but it filled the large bin in about 24-36 hours. It was easy to replace. My only concern was that my old one had 3 screws holing it in place. Two on top and one on the bottom. The new one doesn’t have a way to install the old bottom clip. Since it’s working fine I guess it doesn’t need one. I would highly recommend this as it comes with multiple extra parts to fit most models. It even includes a new water tube.,5

59246,42,Bought for installation in new kitchen. When installed found the snorkel had not been welded to the chimney. Of no use at all. Amazon says call mfr. mfr says call Amazon since they were the ones invoiced. No customer service.  Worthless,1

495182,42,"My biggest objection to a Keurig coffee maker is the ongoing expense and waste of the K-cups.  They are far more expensive than ground coffee.  I also dislike the concept of single-use, disposable things.  When we received a coffee maker for Christmas, we also received an Ekobrew refillable cup.  I have used it some and find it excellent.<br /> - It fits the brewer perfectly.<br /> - It is easy to fill.  I use a small teaspoon so I can spoon in regular coffee without getting it on the rim where the lid seals.<br /> - It is simple to clean.<br /> - IT WORKS!  I like the coffee I have been buying for me drip coffee maker.  The Ekobrew uses that same coffee and brews a single cup that tastes as good as what I am used to.<br /><br />Bottom line: I highly recommend it for reasons of taste, simplicity, economy, and ecology.<br /><br />2/10/2013 update: I have been using it a while.  The only change is that I like it even more!  VERY GOOD PRODUCT!<br /><br />1/7/2017 update: Still going strong.  As I write this, I am sipping on a cup of coffee made with it.

50028,42,"I HATE this washer....and am stuck with it. Have had used washers all my life (45 years of marriage) and all have worked better than this one. It leaves white ""linty- stuff"" all over clothes-- I have to wash dark items 3 times sometimes. Don't believe the Maytag ""help"" on this issue-- I have tried  all of their suggestions with no improvement. I just put a sweater in for the 3rd time. The 2nd wash came out even worse than the 1st (oh dear!)<br /><br />The one good thing I can say about it is that it is big. I do like that aspect. But I conserve water right and left in my So Cal household (collect shower water as it warms, use kitchen water to water outside plants, etc.) and it KILLS me to have to wash a load multiple times. Or even to have to use ""Deep wash"" (which only helps reduce the problem a bit) for every dark load even if the load doesn't actually require deep cleaning.",1

No, it won't stop your washing machine imbalance, but it will reduce the vibration imparted on the floor.

My only question is how long they will last, the bottom has some hallow spots, and it is relatively soft rubber, so I don't see these lasting for years. But for less than 10 bucks, who cares? It solved my annoyance.",5

But even IF this washer doesn't clean as well as previous versions, it still cleans far and away better than the Cabrios I had for 11 years. Very heavy, well-made machines that don't move when they're on. I finally feel like I didn't buy garbage that needs to be replaced every decade or sooner. I love these machines.<br /><br />There was a lot of &#34;dust&#34; inside the washer. It took seven very large, very wet wads of paper towels to eradicate that coating from the drum of the washer, but the dryer had hardly any. Not a big deal. I will never go back to an HE machine again. We've been sold a line of garbage with HE technology. Those machines wash in very little water, but they're on twice as long. And no one takes into account how many times I've had to re-wash clothes because they didn't get clean enough the first time around.

188300,42,"I questioned the 'need' for these, as we'd just use our old basket filters in our peculator. These are AWESOME! Each peculator of coffee has had less and less grounds in the brewed coffee since we began using them, and they take up only about 5% of the space as the basket filters (these get put in a drawer versus taking up valuable space on the counter). The fit is perfect and the price was just about right. These are DEFINITELY on the list to 'Order Again.'",5
437842,42,Very happy I ordered it. I use it in my Keurig machine and it works great for both coffee grounds and tea leaves. I buy a high quality and expensive tea blend. I can select the 6ozs. twice in a row and get 12ozs. of a rich tea flavor! so much easier than trying to brew it any other way.,5

47869,42,"I have whirlpool model ED5PHEXNL00 side by side refrigerator.  It stopped cooling so trying to avoid an expensive visit from the Whirlpool repairman, I looked up on the internet and found the probable cause was the starter relay.  This was the absolute cheapest place to get it and it came in in 3 days.  Direct part swap (the one in the new kit has an orange dot on it).  Took about 5 minutes to completely finish.  Everything is working perfectly now.  All for under $40????  That's crazy good!",5

332085,42,No issues so far and have had for awhile now. Everyone says something about it when they come in my office. Have it on a cabinet in my office to the side.  My old plain jane fridge died so decided on this one which was about the same price as a regular one. Blue light inside is nice feature in the dark and I cant hear it which is nice. My old one hummed.  Looks the best fully stocked. I keep cans of soda and waters for clients in it.,5

214113,42,"In the past, a small refrigerator that I use for a wine cooler stopped working.  I did not discover the failure for several days until I happened to open the small refrigerator and discovered it was very warm inside.  If you have expensive wine stored in a wine cooler that stops working, it can be a costly failure beyond just the repair to the cooler - it can ruin expensive wine.  I purchased a YoLink X3 Temperature & Humidity Sensor and placed it inside the wine cooler.  The LoRa technology used by YoLink provides a reliable signal from the temperature sensor, even though the sensor is enclosed in a metal refrigerator, so my home automation system can now alert me if the wine cooler ever fails again, and I can remedy the problem before the wine is damaged by storage at high temperatures.",5
4712,42,"these are good, but outrageously expensive, they are for a kitchenaid mixer, the mixer has 5 of these and they are sold individually for around 5.00 each,  this was a 4 pack, i had already bought 1 thinking i was getting 5 off another site",5

233380,42,"Time will tell whether it will last as long as my three SS-700 units which are finally failing after many years--no matter how often I descale one unit with vinegar or with Keurig mixtures,  it is unreliable, so I have placed this new one next to it so not to freak out when I'm in a hurry.  Despite some negative reviews, I find this unit a good design although made of lighter materials with a smaller tank. and decidedly better looking  than the ugly Keurig ones. I also note that the price is appreciably lower than the SS-700.. It makes decent coffee and doesn't spray or leak as another reviewer noted.  All in all, it works.",4

144875,42,Lots of space works perfectly thank you,5
333578,42,This thing is amazing.  The LED light is nice. Cleaning is easy. Power beautifully variable.  Not expensive for what you get. Best kitchen buy I think I have ever made.,5
206079,42,I will be sending it back. Could not get a decent cup of coffee to brew. I tried different grinds but the filter would either not allow enough water or too much water to pass through the coffee.,1
385189,42,"Good filters for the fridge but about half the filtering life of the old filters. Sells for a bit cheaper in the two pack but with less filter time between changes, I would prefer the old filters. With this change, the filters actually cost MORE for the same filter capacity (two = 1) so the good deal may not be as good as you think. I think next time I may select non-OEM filters for just that reason unless Amazon has the older ones in stock at a reasonable price.",2
289495,42,Good sturdy product - just wish the wheels rotated 360 degrees,4
116483,42,"It's ok.  Two issues: (1) you give me phillips head screws and a flathead screwdriver (that is too wide to even fit the phillips head screws). Ok, fine, whatever I have a phillips head screwdriver I can use.  But I bought this thing because it said it would extend to 28 inches. I'd say it's good for 26 inches at best and then it wont hold any meaningful weight without collapsing.  If you dont need it to extend more than 26 inches then it's probably decent enough (I don't think it would hold 300 pounds though) otherwise look elsewhere.",3
455373,42,"Seemed OK, but they did not identify which one is the high tension medium tension and low tension. There may be a tiny difference in the thickness of the metal but looking as closely as I can I'm not even sure. Therefore oh, it's a guessing game. The ones I used before we're color coded and or where stamped with a designation. This is a major problem!",2
480521,42,"I purchased this to brew stronger coffee, like most of you.  However, it has certainly taken the convenience and ease out of the single cup brewing process....with all the prep and trickery and cleaning and leaking and ...what not.<br /><br />I am a mechanical design engineer/manufacturing engineer familiar with designing parts from metal and plastic injection molded products, like the gray base and the mating gray screw-on cover.<br /><br />The problem with any machined or molded parts/assemblies is tolerances, especially with plastic injection-molded products.  There is a &#34;recipe&#34; for such molded parts when filling the mold with hot flowing &#34;liquid&#34; plastic quickly....it's time and temperature dependant.  Each run of manufacturing the My K Cup can be slightly different in dimensions by a few mere thousandths of an inch...creating a &#34;gap&#34; when the assembly is used.  Possibly...<br /><br />In the My K Cup design, there are multiple interfaces where loose or out-of-spec tolerances can cause a problem...ie, the thickness of the filter basket is dimension x.xxx&#34;, and there exists the gap between the gray base and the gray cover of x.xxx&#34; when assembled.  if all these dimensions and tolerances do not provide a leak-proof seal, there is a good chance the pressurized water will flow up to the cap and over the rim of the basket filter flange....and taking coffee grinds down into your cup.<br /><br />I have tried all the solutions listed on so many good reviews (and used some of them below)....however, besides being a chore, I still got a different strength cup of coffee.  Today, I finally realized what the solution to this problem is---it's missing a compliant gasket to eliminate any dimensional shortcomings between the dimensions of the flanged threads on the base and the cover, and the thickness of the flange on the filter basket, etc.<br /><br />so I decided to take some aluminum foil from the roll and create a seal to accommodate for any possible tolerance issues.  I pulled out about 4 inches of aluminum foil, and folded it in half.  now I had a piece of foil measuring 2 inches by 12 inches long, but 2x thick.  I then cut 2&#34;x2&#34; squares to cover just more than the diameter of the filter basket diameter.  I also poked a hole in the center for those three fins found on the underside of the gray cover to allow for the hot water to enter the filter basket.  Basically, I've replicated the foil found on original K-Cup design, but without the adhesive seal.  Guess what?  It worked!!  Finally, no trimming of old K-Cups, no reusing old K-Cups...which may or may not be a health concern as others have mentioned.<br /><br />so to make it hopefully more simple to follow, here's what I did, which includes hints and tips from many other commenters.<br /><br />1) remove the rubber gasket/o-ring from the puncturing needle from the head of the unit, place a #10 stainless steel washer on the post, and carefully place the rubber gasket/o-ring back onto the post in the same orientation as it was before you removed it.  This will keep the rubber gasket/o-ring from sliding back up the post.<br />2) grind coffee or coffee beans to a fine grind.  5-10 seconds in the small coffee bean grinder.  too fine will allow fine coffee particles thru the screen...<br />3) place filter basket into gray base (i used a tall shot glass to hold the gray base during this process)<br />4) fill the filter basket 75% and lightly tamp down<br />5) prepare the 2 ply aluminum foil square so it's 2&#34; x 2&#34; square and place atop the filter basket<br />6) fold aluminum squares around the edge of the basket and gray base<br />7) while holding aluminum square in place, puncture center of foil with something to create about a 1/4&#34; hole.<br />8) screw the gray cover onto the base.  (Note, this can be tricky if the foil is on the threads between the gray base and gray cover...but it's not a steep learning curve...you'll get the hang of it.)<br /><br />so having done this, i anxiously pressed start...and FINALLY, I got a good strong cup of coffee with freshly ground Starbucks French Roast!  the only grinds in my mug was the too-finely ground coffee.  I have to get that grind time down better...or learn to live with leaving 1/8&#34; of basically cold coffee at the end of my cup of morning Joe...<br /><br />Kerig...perhaps you can add a permanent gasket to the underside of the cover?  I would think then you have this common complaint eliminated.",2
334317,42,"It does not always hold the door ""latch"" in place but sometimes the flap needs to be put back in place, and at least it stays.

594430,42,It makes ice as advertised however unit doesn’t keep them cold enough so you have to remove them ASAP and place in the freezer. Otherwise ice just melts. Also machine comes with option to make large and small cubes. Large cubes are small so I always make large. Problem is they melt quickly as well when you use them in cooler. This really is only good for functions or everyday drink use. Nothing more,2

I use my washing machine as an extra counter space in my kitchen, so this cover is perfect.  The material is very smooth.  It repels water.  When water gets on it, it just sits there and doesn't soak through. It is easy to wipe  away liquids and crumbs and doesn't easily get dirty.  It fits my washing machine perfectly with room to spare.  The back is open which I like because of the hose and things on the back of the washing machine.

I figured out what was going on - the convention coil at the rear of the assisting w/ the preheat and then once it reached temperature it would turn off and the regular ""bake"" coil at the bottom of the fridge would take over.  However since our bottom coil was burnt out it would begin losing temperature after the convention coil shut off.<br /><br />Anyway, installation is significantly different than most electric ovens where the baking coil is visible inside the oven.  I had a bit of a difficult time figuring out HOW to remove this coil there isn't a lot of info on the web.  I finally figure it out after looking at diagrams from one of the other ""fix it"" websites for a similar model.  On our double oven the bake coil on the top oven went out.  I had to pull the oven out of the wall to replace it by stack up some items (boxes of laminate flooring) so that I had something that was the same level to put it on.  This oven is HEAVY, really heavy.  I took a good amount of the oven apart trying to figure out how to get the coil pack out.  Here is some advice for swapping out the coil on the top oven -<br /><br />TURN OFF THE POWER TO THE OVEN(S) AT THE BREAKER PANEL<br />1) Pull the oven out of the wall about 4-6 inches.<br />2) Remove the latching mechanism in the top of the bottom oven<br />3) The metal plate between the two oven needs to be removed.  There are screws on the side of the oven to do this.  You may need to use a screwdriver to pop out the plate.<br />4) Look between the two ovens and you will see a push on cotter pin on the bottom of the top oven.  Pull it out...<br />5) After the pin is out there is a panel/door that will drop down and allow you to pull out the box containing the heat element/coil.",5

93830,42,"After researching that a GE OEM replacement timer knob for my GE Dryer was over thirty-dollars, I found what was was to be compatible with the GE Part number. These knobs offered a no-questions asked, lifetime warranty and so I purchased them. Once received, they looked exactly like the GE OEM Time knob, but when I swapped it out with the old knob, I saw that knob was not a snug fit to the shaft of the timer. Turning the replacement knob between the control settings, you could see and feel the play, which eventually will cause failure of the knob.<br /><br />Knowing that these replacement knobs aren't a snug fit, like the OEM knobs, I took the GE version apart and found that there's a fitted metal sleeve that' inside the GE knob, which gives years of longevity to the factory parts. In an effort to make these new knobs work similar to the GE knobs, but this metal insert won't fit.<br /><br />Due to what I found out, comparing the GE and these replacement knobs, I cannot recommend them or can I recommend paying $32.10 to an online appliance parts seller. I'd recommend using one to these online sellers search out the exact part, compare sellers and but the actual appliance manufacturer's part and forget the cheap replacements like I've done.

Remember to flip the fliter each refill and add a splash of vinegar to the water to keep everything cleaner longer and to do a thorough clean of your humidifier reservoir and tray every couple of weeks.

502929,42,"Since I’m anal about researching items before I buy them, I researched the AcuRite and sensors before purchasing. I wanted to monitor the indoor temperature in the house while I am out. After reviewing customer responses, I put batteries in the sensors before starting any configuration. The setup went well and I think having the sensors enabled helped. I agree with customers that instructions are vague. I was waiting for downloads/updates on the unit but could tell if they were done according to AcuRites instructions. After waiting 2 hours I assumed updates were done (lights blinking/solid on their instructions were no help determining if finished).<br /><br />The Hub found all the sensors however as another customer commented, you don’t know which one to use. I wanted one in the basement, one in the main house and one outside. Took me a few hours to figure out which temperature was related to that sensor. I did have to do a reset a few times for the sensors to show the actual reading. Since a few were off, I tried to adjust (calibrate) on the web site. It never took. I deleted those and added them again (removed batteries before) with the calibration I wanted. They then displayed correctly.<br />All is working now and thru a few adjustments mentioned above it is working. I also previously had an AcuRite 5 in 1 outdoor unit and it found that as well. So now I can see all the house including the outdoor 5 in 1 unit.<br /><br />Considering all the other options out on the market, this seems to be working for me. I hope not to experience failure in the system in a few months like others have reported.

304640,42,"I tried fixing my ice issues by learning about how ice is made in our refrigerators and after using the built in diagnostics in my refrigerator I was able to get my freezer to start making ice again, slowly and then it stopped. I troubleshot everything from the optics circuit board that tells the ice maker to stop producing ice because the ice bin is full to changing out the control head which tells the heater to heat and the motor to turn and eject the ice and finally to fill the ice tray with water, making it ready for the next batch. My ice maker was doing all that, except it was making 10 cubes in 24 hours....not enough. So I finally ordered this new ice maker and right away it started making lots of ice. Now, I did have to change over some components off my old ice maker but that was not difficult. Many of the ice makers seem to fit a wide variety of refrigerators, check your application first.",4

We have dirty dishes every time. We are very disappointed with this product. Also the racks are made for Europe's smaller dishes and the racks don't work well for US larger dishes. We complained to Bosch about it not cleaning the dishes within the first month, but they didn't have a repairman come until the first month was up. We would like to return it, but we are unable to because of the first month time limit. I did not buy this via Amazon. I wish had because they are better to work with. They try to make the customer satisfied. I purchased at Best Buy, but since we buy most of our stuff at Amazon I wanted to share what I learned.

544177,42,"OK, it's a no-brainer decision to get this unit.  When our 11-year-old Kenmore (model #:106.56826600) ice maker died I decided a DIY approach made the most sense given the cost of a service call vs a straight out replacement.  Like other reviewers I first went to Google/YouTube and got smart on how the system works.  I developed a &#34;Probable Cause&#34; checklist and initially considered a frozen water line the culprit.  First, I removed the old ice maker to access the water line....Steps: Remove the ice maker door, tape shut the left hand ice level sensor door, and push in the two catches under the ice maker...it will slide right out (don't forget to disconnect the wires).  Wow, the water tube coming from the top of the fridge was frozen solid so I used a small funnel and hairdryer set on low to melt the blockage.  I reinstalled the unit only to find it still didn't work so I moved to step two and used the &#34;jumper wire&#34; procedure to manually advance the timer wheel...it failed both tests. I then realized the frozen water line wasn't  the problem, but was due to water backing up since the old unit had totally failed.  There was an additional  YouTube video that discussed replacing the ice maker's small motor and doing some soldering that I decided was not worth my time so I ordered the Supco unit.  It arrived as expected, the instructions are excellent and written for a DIYer vs appliance tech. Another reviewer called the unit &#34;cheaply made&#34;...I disagree, I thought it's construction was more than adequate for the task, after all it's an ice maker not a Pace Maker.  The unit went in easier than taking out the old one.  Don't forget to position the water line inside the small fill cup...long-handled needle nose pliers work well here.  Be sure to save all the old unit pieces and hardware as you'll need them in the new unit.  As a final step and maybe unneeded I cycled the power to the entire fridge, via circuit breaker with the ice maker switched off.  My thought was to clear any remaining fault codes, much like rebooting a computer after installing updates.  The ice maker dumped out it's first load of cubes a little over two hours later.  I discarded the first three batches and installed a new fridge filter (it was nearly due anyway).  Over night the ice tray filled and the ice level optical system worked perfectly shutting off the ice maker when the hopper filled. Finally, the Supco ice maker produces more and better quality cubes than the old one ever did.  So, for $45 and an hour of your time this is a no-brainer fix.",5

It’s hard to imagine ever needing another dryer vent hose. Still, it’s not able to withstand unreasonable abuse, so treat it like the lightweight metal that it is.

There are only 30 in a pack so if you make more than one carafe or 14oz-18oz tall travel mugs per day, one pack won't last a whole month. For regular drip coffee filters you gets hundreds of them for just a couple dollars. Paying 6-7 dollars for 30 paper filters is a bit hard on my pocketbook, especially when you consider the reason you are using the fillable pods in the first place is to same money and be more economical.

649390,42,Took off Maytag dryer back panel 8 screws. Lower left side is the cycling thermostat. 1 screw and 4 wires. Simple replacement. Dryer works perfect again. 2 thumbs up.,5
379984,42,The hole in the holder doesn't line up with the needle and there isn't a hole in the basket.<br />I have zero intent on modifying anything to make this work. It was supposed to fit.,1
657765,42,Can't beat the price and it does work.,5
207888,42,"Well, these come as a package of 3 and the price for three is right at the price of one OEM unit.  Pretty much do the same thing.  Fit in the fridge perfectly.  Will buy again.",5
149919,42,Love this preventative piece for my coffee makers.,5
385878,42,Bought for a new place after seeing a video on this. The shop vac attachment made clean-up a breeze. Highly recommend,5
338449,42,"This washing machine has been a life saver! Its easy to use and lightweight i usually just put in in my bathtub and wash my clothes there im pretty amazed at all the clothes i can wash ! Only thing i dont like is the water cable thing is too short! Im still looking for one longer but for now i have to add buckets of water and add it which is tough lol. For blankets towels i would go to the reg laundry for them once a month , but this machine is great! Im trying to get a drying machine because i hate having the clothes hang up on a rack lol which takes longer if you have plenty of clothes to dry! For ex. I wash a loqd of clothes and hang it on the rack next day is dry and this is when i can wash more clothes ! Crazy right? But its helping one way or the other lol",4
633960,42,"Love it.  Lid stays on all the time, fits tight.  easy to fill and clean.  Would order again",5
112357,42,"I have been using their pp-Code WiFi Watchman for years and they have worked very reliably for me. I like their products and the easy to use web portal.  Their support was very helpful during the initial setup. I chose to move to the Lora WAN version of the product because the wifi was not quite reaching my chicken coop  and I wanted to place a sensor to monitor the temp & humidity in the coop.  Things are working great thus far and I get updated reading about every 15mins.  This is just in time for the winter so I can know if my girls (chickens) get too cold.  I will add another sensor when I can so I can monitor the barn which is too far for the Wifi in my house to reach at all.  If you have a large property and want to monitor temp/pressure/humidity, this is the product for you.",5
488526,42,"Great price for humidifier filters, especially  since I replace them monthly.  They fit great in my Vornado evap40.  I’ve bought many Filterbuy brand filters and have been happy with all my purchases. Will definitely be purchasing again.",5
415873,42,"My dryer has been working like new since we installed it. Very happy, didn’t need to call a repair man. Saved a lot of money 👍🏽",5
168062,42,"So far, the filter is working just like the original one that came with the coffee maker.  It improved the flavor of the coffee and it tastes like it used to be.  The service was also pretty fast.",5
227715,42,Louder than our previous one (same model). Shipping/delivery was not as simple as it should have been.,3
152587,42,I really like this but I have to hit the power button after ever time Ice drops in the bucket. It’s very annoying. It doesn’t continuously make ice. I have to hit the power button again and again!!! The add water light comes on each cycle but the water is not low!!!!,3
452568,42,This handle did not work for me. Only half of the handle is secure to my dryer. I can not properly open my dryer.,1
400355,42,"Bought this to seal sugar cookie bags. You have to play around a little to figure out the best setting for each type of bag, but once you find the right setting, it’s a breeze. I’ve sealed a couple hundred cookie bags so far and haven’t had a problem. This is a huge time saver when you have a lot of bags to seal. Definitely a good buy.",5
231373,42,Perfect fit for my Cusinart and you can not best the price!!! thanks,5
145139,42,And now I don't need to junk the refrigerator!,5
553066,42,"I bought these because have a habit of shopping for groceries based on what I remember being in the fridge or not. When in the original cartons, I'd assume we had plenty of eggs and not buy more only to get home and discover otherwise. (Teenagers, amirite?! Haha!)<br />Anyway, they clear, beautiful, and hold plenty for our large family. They seem pretty sturdy, but when washing, be gentle. They're acrylic-type of material and solid, but I can see these cracking if you're not gentle enough. Overall, a good buy!",5
653517,42,Never worked when I received this ice maker it had an oil residue all over box when opened oil residue cleaned off ice maker put water in and plugged in left on for an hour. Never made one cube of ice. The oil residue was the refrigerant/ Freon what ever they put in. Item was return in September and is now November and still no refund,1
93829,42,My appliance friend who is also a appliance repair person had asked me to order this product.  So far it seems to work and has taken care of the leaking problem that I had with my fridge.,5
131744,42,THE DRYER FILTERS FIT AND WORK VERY GOOD,5
297750,42,The owner overloads the washer and dryer - this over-temp fuse blows when the dryer load is so big that not enough air passes through to cool the inlet temperature. I have gotten so that it's a ten minute good to change it - first time maybe 30 minutes.,5
488518,42,Installs easily and works perfectly. The unit was supplied with orifices for either propane or natural gas. It hooks up to standard one half inch gas pipe threads. There is a fitting supplied to use a flexible hose. When I first lit it the flame was very weak so I changed the orifices and then it worked fine. Changing them is very easy and they even supply a tool  (basically a socket wrench). There is no need to adjust the flame.  I am very happy with it so far.,5
373106,42,"this fits very nice on my dryer, is useful, but the hose part is way to short, wish it would of been a lot longer to reah and empty",3
452679,42,The 2006A is a good water filter but if you can afford the 2006B I would recommend it but you will not be disappointed with the 2006A,4
608812,42,"This little washing machine is a powerhouse! I can wash a pair of x-large women's jeans and several shirts in a load! I'm very happy with the compact size, it fits in my RV easily and can be moved around simply if needed because it weighs very little. Given the decision again I'd buy it. I'm not disappointed.",5
99934,42,Buttons work now too easy to install!,5
654425,42,"These are very good quality filters. The two items should easily last the entire heating season keeping the air moist and more healthful. I clean the filter weekly in a basin with water and bleach, which helps remove any mineral residue that builds up during the week. After many weeks, it's time for a replacement with the second, new filter. Thanks for the good service and prompt shipping.",5
186824,42,very low power. not enough to loosen up any dirt.,1
587251,42,"Exactly the right item, work great, much less expensive than the GE verison.",5
305540,42,just want was needed. easy to wash.,5
200565,42,Great replacement at a good price.,5
182614,42,I will definitely be ordering these filters again.,5
229767,42,Easy to install replacement water filter. No problems.,5
477619,42,"I finally got around to reviewing this product, but it's wonderful. It looks good it really moves air fast and the lights are perfect. The fan filters totally cover the underside so there's no part that isn't protected from grease or whatever. It's easy to clean and I highly recommend this range hood. I'm pretty handy and installed it myself, you might be able to also. But a professional will have no trouble. Replacing an old unit of the same size is easy compared to a new installation I believe. But this is a solid, well made range hood that works great and looks good.",5
265257,42,These work well but they require a really squarely cut off tubing pushed in all the way...otherwise they leak.,4
562426,42,"Fit pretty good,  saved space for sure.",5
351878,42,Very happy with my purchase. The previous knob was damaged and made my stove look old. The knob was easy to attach and restored my stove to look new again. It fitted perfectly.,5
41526,42,"Worked well for 1.5 years , then it started to develop rust. Need to have stainless cube maker to prevent rust residue.",3
302798,42,"Ice maker works great.  However, I had to make a trip to Lowes to find a screw because the hole on the bottom of the ice maker that holds part of the plastic frame was smaller than the original. Other than that slight frustration, all is well.",4
576079,42,the Reusable Gold Plated Mesh Coffee filters are perfect and easy to use. I opened up the box and began to use the product. Easy to clean Easy to fill with your Favorite Coffee. You need to order this product rite now!!!,5
259791,42,"These burner covers are nice looking and contrary to what a few reviewers have said, they are heavy-duty enough to allow the cook to take a heavy pot off of a burner and put it on top of one of the burner covers.",5
587044,42,"The filter is a good product, but this particular seller (Ruoying) shipped it in a flimsy box too small to protect it. It arrived crushed and leaking. Unusable.",1
39193,42,Just like what came with our April Air humidifier.  Cost considerably less than at the box store.,5
43690,42,The loudest most problematic maker..only had it 6 months and it hasn’t worked in 3 months.  I e called support but ultimately gave up.,1
162725,42,Getting this part and doing a self installation saved us about 300 dollars over having a repairman come do the same job. Extremely worthwhile and saw an immediate improvement in how our dryer operated.,5
336130,42,My copy is very accurate when I compared  the humidity and temperature functions with a non electronic instrument. Highly recommended.,5
668525,42,LEAKAGE WARNING! MY FLOORING IS RUINED!!!,1
633104,42,"Seemed like a good product but did not fit my model when it said it would. As you can see from the pictures, the shape of the original white plastic tongs that engage the shaft are not the same shape as the replacement part. I spent so much time & frustration disassembling & trying to make it fit! Update: they No longer list my model. Maybe I originally misread it? Additional update: I ended up pushing pretty hard to seat the assembly onto the shaft. I thought it worked but the next time I disassembled the blade for cleaning, the plastic attachments were worn smooth and I don’t think the chopping blade was turning anymore 😣",2
537863,42,Love the size of the ice. Love the machine. Was gifted for Christmas and it’s stopped working after the return window :(,1
22079,42,"I've used the plastic version of this filter holder for a number of years.  Didn't even know a porcelain version was available, until I was looking to replace my plastic one. The cone drip filter is in my opinion the best way to make coffee.  Easy, tastes great, and the whole thing can be put away out of sight when it is not in use.<br /><br />The ceramic filter holder works fine, but there is one issue that I had not thought of. The ceramic holder is shorter than the plastic holder.  The paper filters are too tall. When the paper filters stick up higher than the holder, the paper wicks coffee water all the way to the top, over the rim of the holder, even though I'm using less water at a time due to the smaller capacity of the holder. One solution I have thought of but not yet tried, is to take scissors and cut the paper filters shorter.  Also, I have to run extra water through the filter to get the same amount of coffee that I used to get from one pouring with the plastic holder.",4
650065,42,"One filter at box store is the same price as all four of these.  They are a bit thin...if you hold them up to the light, they have some big spaces where the light shines through.  I do have a 3M brand hammock filter I could cut to put behind this, but would have to tack it down with thread in a few spots to keep the hood fan from sucking up the loose hammock filter cloth.  In any event, I don't care because nearly $15.00 bucks for one local box store filter is too rich for me thanks.  I would rather retrofit these with a hammock filter than waste money at the box store.",4

603272,42,Works fine. Quite a bit more flimsy than the factory version.,4
196381,42,Good price.. Everything fit except the screws that connect the metal bracket to the washer.. Wouldn't go in with a hand screw driver.  Switched over to a power drill and it just erased the threads on the screws.  Get yours self some self tapping metal screws and you're set.. Other than that. Great product,4
289162,42,"2 of the 4 burner covers were bent when they arrived, so I was unable to install them. Otherwise good quality.",3

514482,42,"Oh my! We thought this was frivolous purchase, but I tell you what! We LOVE it! No more trips to get ice. No more expensive filters for the freezer water supply. We even took it on an RV trip. Not having to worry about stopping to get ice was amazing. I wasn’t sure it was going to be worth it. We plug it in as soon as we arrive and by the time we finish setting up (15-20min) there’s enough ice for two big cocktails!",5
174790,42,"Cheap and low quality, can see right through the supposed carbon, and only one side is wired. Get the original quality one from Whirlpool even though it cost more.",1

490679,42,The only issue I had was the plastic center piece was too small for my kenmore agitator. I had to put the old one back in. Not a big deal because it works. It’s better than spending $500+ on a new washer!,4

390547,42,I needed a cover for my washer as its prone to sunlight and if it rains hard enough...the wind could blow in and get it. So i decided to buy this cover. It does the job...its not very thick which i like as i would now worry about the machine getting too hot while its working. It came a bit bigger than i had expected...so i made a few minor adjustments. (better too big and too small). Would purchase again when i get a dryer.,5

52831,42,"I did some research on the water filters for my new Cuisinart coffeemaker, and found that the Cuisinart filters would end up costing me a pretty penny, so I looked for an alternative.  I found the KJ Charcoal filters, and I have given them a try.  I have found that they are sturdy, an exact fit, and a darn sight cheaper than the Cuisinart filters.  Of course, it came in a 12-pack, so I have a year's worth of filters in my cupboard.  I used to think that the water filters were a waste of time, but I have discovered that they do make a difference in the way my coffee tastes.  I intend to keep using the KJ brand - they sell a descaler, also.",5
319307,42,"This item works like a charm easy install and my dryer is working again ,thanks again.",5
688329,42,Half the price of the big appliance parts guys. The harness to attach the wires was longer than the original but it’s better longer than shorter. The excess is easily tucked up and out of the way next to the fill tube.,5

410762,42,"I was not impressed with this beast when I first got it. It says not to pre-wash your dishes but after running for three hours, some of the dishes were still dirty. If I need to pre-wash my dishes to get them clean, the machine had better run them in half an hour. I cussed this machine when I first got it running but after my wife discovered the TURBO Manly setting, it started washing dishes like I expected it to, and in one hour instead of three. The instruction manual needs more tips on how to run this thing and fix alarms when they pop up. I'm not fully sold on it yet but I'm a lot happier with it.",3

360668,42,Awesome! Works perfectly. Glad this company found a way to bypass Keurig's stupid system. Worth every penny. Every time I drink a cup of my own coffee I smile. Don't have to use EXPENSIVE K-Cups anymore.,5
683775,42,It did not fit properly. The knob was very loose fitting and would not turn the timer properly.,1

284936,42,Love these coffee socks! They're super easy to use and make me feel good about limiting waste during my daily cup(s) of coffee.,5
641784,42,Bought this as a supplement for our fridge ice maker.  Starts dropping ice within 10 minutes.  My wife is an ice chewer and she loves the ice it makes.  If you move the made ice to your freezer you need to stir it up after about a minute or the ice will stick together in a mass.  The reservoir has a small drain plug under the unit that is a PIA. I don't know yet about longevity but it serves a good purpose so far.,4
555501,42,I like the small size I just set it by me on the end table when I’m setting on the couch or on my bedside table when I’m sleeping. Small enough to easily take with me when I travel.,4
694325,42,I was looking for something that wouldn't let pieces of rooibos through while steeping.  This did the trick.  I think I'll order another one for my office.,5
240334,42,Saw this as a “must have” on a Buzzfeed list. Not impressed. Does what it advertises - filling in the gap between the stove and counter- but is just another part of the kitchen to keep clean. Doesn’t sit well in crevasse and often needs to be put back in place.,2

549296,42,These filters perform better and last longer than the very expensive Vornado filters. I would recommend them to my friends.,4
553450,42,They don't last .  this is the second one I have had. They must burn out or something. Took it all apart and put back still doesn't work. Couldn't see anything wrong but of the two they both lasted long enough so I couldn't return about 2 months then they just quit.Really like it when it works.but I'm not going to buy one every 2 months.,1
277956,42,This is a great icemaker ... easy to use and has a fairly small footprint on the kitchen counter,5
335776,42,Great product for older style stoves,5

I installed the 2nd kit and will see how long it last. If they only last 6 months then obviously it's not worth purchasing. With all the aggravation of having to empty out the freezer and defrost the coils to install the new components just not worth it.

Use some surgical hemostats and a magnetic 1/4 inch nut driver to get the job done.  Having nimble fingers helps too.  Put the wires onto the fuse before you install the part under its mounting tab.  You don't really want to drop the fuse nor any screws into the inner depths of the dryer.<br /><br />Replace both the fuse and the upper temperature limit switch,  as the limit switch is most likely shorted closed - you may also have a dust clog that is causing the dryer to overheat and eat fuses.",5

333233,42,"Needed a washer for our apartment that was portable, ran on 110V, and didn't need extensive hookups. Panda brand was usually the recommended and highest rated ones so I opted to grab this vs a Black and Decker or Magic chef model, besides for $40 or so more I could have just a little more capacity. When the package arrived there was no damage and everything looked good, packaging was nice and it was great having to just lift the box up instead of trying to dig this thing out of Styrofoam. Manuals and documentation are a little lost in translation, but you get the idea after plugging it up and playing around with the washer. So far my biggest complaint is that the tub itself has severe cracking and pieces missing, there was no rattling in the tub nor did I see any loose debris, so its possible this tub was damaged during production and was assembled with it; It seems to not affect the functionality but I worry over time it might split down or have serious issues when doing a spin cycle.<br /><br />Speaking of functions, as a washer this thing works great. We washed a microfiber throw and some towels for the test run and they all came out smelling clean and dried off really well, only thing so far is that the ball lock valve for the sink adapter leaks a little bit when its on standby, but not by much.<br /><br />Overall this is a great washer if your apartment doesn't have hookups and their facility costs $4+ a load for some small standard washer, however I'm going to knock it some points because it left the factory damaged; With all the neat packaging you would have thought someone at QA caught the damaged tub, I'll revise after getting in contact with Panda and seeing how that goes.",3

523216,42,"Terrible. This is way too small and water goes down super slow. Ironically I got the #1 filter from this same brand where it said #1 filter paper would fit but it doesn’t! Worse still, it takes forever for the water to go down. Don’t waste your money.",1
202155,42,Very economical and fits perfectly and arrived on time. Would recommend it to people and love to order it again.,5
337085,42,Great product and super easy to use with the very flexible rods.  Exceeded my expectations,5
214398,42,Compatible to the original LG and cost much less,5

566255,42,GREAT KIT FOR SIMPLIFYING YOUR REFRIGERATOR,5
271357,42,Can only use this for one cap at a time. Looks like three caps can be done.,1
355236,42,They only thing is that I wish the caps were in color to remember to take the cap off to install.,5
514885,42,Does what its supposed to do,5
78451,42,My family eat a lot of eggs and this save me a lot of spaces!,5
440184,42,"arrived on time, before than i expected!! good quality, it fits my amana dryer cord conection.",4
538016,42,"Easy install , much cheaper than GE product & works great!!",5
639424,42,nice to buy parts off Amazon like this,5
333949,42,A great value for these fridge filters and they work great!,5
326403,42,"So far, this has saved us a fortune in filters.  We brew a few pots of coffee each day and several single servings each day in our Ninja.  This does the job. No complaints.",4
174743,42,Read the reviews about glue failing but I bought anyway.  Used the same clear latex caulk the countertop installers use.  These brackets aren't going anywhere.,5
121599,42,Finally got the right size.. (Meddium),4
140893,42,"I love it!!! Easy too see the measurement, wright weight, easy too clean. Perfect for me!!",5
103990,42,I love that this products breaks in two to have two sections for smaller loads! Very durable!,5
123499,42,"Work great, not sure why they ask for the flavor rating....saving tons of money on K-cups now!",5
318314,42,Element that arrived is completely different than picture.,1
398712,42,They were easy to install and very sturdy and a great price!,5
182533,42,They're coffee pods. They hold coffee. The end.,4
357653,42,"Fits Frigidaire FGHD2433KF1 and its various finish variations just fine.  If you're looking at this product you probably own the dishwasher so an actual review is somewhat pointless -- of the several design flaws common to Frigidaire-branded dishwashers, this contains at least two of them.  The most serious is the use of a nylon axle and spindle for the impeller drive shaft and food-grinding chamber -- it's easily stripped at the splines or sheared at the edge of the grind chamber.  They should have used a metal axle and spindle -- but come to that, they should have sold it separately so you aren't obliged to pay the price of a new motor to get a thirty cent part.  Why didn't they?  Well, you're a captive market, and replacement parts are lucrative.  Enjoy.",3
475739,42,"They work just as good as the Namebrand. We go through about 2/year, change them as soon as the filter light warns. Have bought this 3 pack about 3 times now. No complaints.",5
300080,42,Worked perfectly. Thrift store mixer plus this plastic bit. Total under $15 for a mixer that would cost a few hundred dollars new. I didn't know that you could rebuild the KitchenAide mixers. Made a great gift for our daughter.,5
496424,42,"I bought this range only a few months ago and am very happy with it. It replaces a DCS range that basically fell apart. The oven temps are accurate and the convection works very well. The range top is easy to keep clean and the 5 burners feature a variety of useful sizes and power settings. The cast iron grates are heavy and sensibly designed. All in all, I am VERY happy with this piece of gear. I looked at many different ranges before I settled on this one.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have now owned this range for nearly a year and everything I have said above still stands. The convection oven has proved itself to be outstanding and I bake regularly. No more turning bread in the oven to get uniform browning. Everything has stood up well to pretty hard use (I cook a LOT).",5
295933,42,This machine stopped working 10 months after purchase. The trouble shooting manual is advising I contact customer service. The owners manual suggests I have a refrigerant leak due to the ice not being made. I think I’ll just go back to buying bagged ice!,1
359985,42,I bought this back in December of 2014.  I did not read the warnings so was not aware you were supposed to wear goggles and gloves.  You get the same warnings with bleach.  Just be careful and don't touch your eyes before you wash your hands.  I do not use it every time I fill the tank; maybe once a week.  The bottle lasts a long time.<br />I have not experienced any unpleasant odor.<br />The measuring is a nuisance: 1/8 of a cap.  I use one of the medicine cups that come with liquid cold medicine.  A cap is 2 TBL.  1/8 of 2 TBL is approximately 3/4 tsp.<br />Does it work?  I have no idea.  In any case I have not noticed any moldy smell so I assume it does.,4
509295,42,"It will be another month or so before we have the chance to try out the cook top to be able to say we like it or not. The delivery was on time, the package wasn't damaged, that's good news.",5
321760,42,"They did not fit correctly in my Samsung, causing the refrigerator to leak after installing. Leaked at the fiter/frig connection. Bad seal due to incorrect fitting. Tried all 3 and each leaked. never leaked prior. have since purchased other filters and they dont leak.",1
155064,42,"I purchased this insert as a replacement for a cheaper vent that quit working. My husband easily installed it. I have only had it for 2 weeks, and so far it working great! The lights are nice and bright.",5
501904,42,Product is suppose to be a replacement for a Kenmore Stove. They are poorly made and the 8in drip pans are oversized. It is strange because the 6in drip pans fit perfectly. I would like a replacement or my money back.,5
430624,42,It's OK it makes good coffee. The only problem is turning it on at 4AM in the morning. The start button is very hard to get the right amount of time. I've threatened my wife to shoot the thing when I can't get it going!!!,1
578234,42,"I liked the size,using , using for smoking",4
280299,42,"Our refrigerator's icemaker went out and repairs were to be quite delayed due to the holidays and supply issues. Got this as we figured it would solve our temporary issue, and give us an option for gatherings and such. It was great to setup and the cubes are clear and it was faster than I thought it would be.<br />.<br />However, as several of the reviews indicated, you will need to adjust the cube size to help reduce your efforts at separating the cubes. It's kinda easy to do, but you do not want to punch out the plastic bin. It keeps things cold, but not enough for a long time.<br />.<br />In summary, it works, and the cubes are clear and tasteless after the initial batch. Reduce the size of the cube to reduce the need to separate every cube.",4
492169,42,Steps to replace:<br />1. Remove 5 screws attaching hinge to dryer (with someone holding the door so it doesn’t fall).<br />2. Lift up door and hinge assembly vertical until two hinge clips release free.<br />3. Place door outside face down and unscrew 6 screws around circumference of inside door. Lift inside door away from outside.<br />4. Unscrew first set of 2 screws securing hinge.<br />5. Unscrew second set of 2 screws securing hinge.<br />6. Remove hinge assembly by pulling hinge opposite inside door.<br />Reverse order to reinstall. Keep track of which screws go where there are three types.  Also hand tighten the 6 interior door screws given they seat into plastic. They strip easily if not careful.,5
533591,42,I can't see any problems with this filter. It installed just as the original and works just as good so far as I can tell. It will be nice to have one that lasts for a year as well!,5
110446,42,Great accessory to the Keurig coffee maker.  Can use our own favorite coffee flavors for a fraction of the cost of buying the prepackaged ones.,5
120117,42,I normally am the handy man around my place. When the wife bought it to my attention that the washer needed a repair I looked around and found this gasket for a fair price compare to other vendors. The product arrived on time in good order. I installed it with much concern. I did need  help  stretching the band to fix the gasket in place. all in all it was pretty simple. If we ever need another one I will purchase it from here.,5
438626,42,"The rollers I received were not as shown in the picture. The factory rollers have a bushing that allows the roller to spin on the shaft. Several vendors have an upgrade version that has a roller-bearing instead of the bushing. The photo of this part clearly shows the bearing instead of a bushing. The ones I was sent had the bushing.  As my drier was down for the count, I did not have the luxury of returning them.  They are priced like the bearing version, but are  the bushing version.",1
492962,42,"It worked well for 6 months then I noticed it’s taking a long time to dry a load.  Dryer starts cutting off heat way too early,  replaced this with another from a different brand.",2
56524,42,This kit didn't fit my stove.,1
449499,42,"This cone doesn't fit flat into the brew basket of the Zojirushi EC-DAC50 even though the manufacturer claims that it is designed for the coffeemaker.  The quality of the basket is great and will provide many years of reliable service, but don't expect it to fill seamlessly into the brew basket.  I would recommend it if you don't want the added expense of the paper filters and the fact that there is less waste by using this brew basket.",3
446082,42,Works great and the price was right.,5
3385,42,It didn’t hold the washing machine like it would be doing.,1
520313,42,only place that I could find it a an great value for the money,5
86151,42,What an awesome gadget.  Think I'll be ordering more of these as stocking stuffers for all my friends who own Keurig coffeemakers.  No more over filling the k cup replacement holders and no more spilled coffee grounds on the counter. Love it.,5
426044,42,Pretty easy to install<br />Shipping was slow but faster than the estimated delivery time.,4
460653,42,"Horrible! Falls apart, extremely thin material. Bends by touch! Not worth the money.",1
270632,42,"My fridge started getting louder and louder.  I pulled it away from the wall and found a broken blade.  I ordered this part, it was her in two days and it fit perfect.  No more loud fridge!!",5
572563,42,Great quality product. Fits my Whirlpool Range. When placing burners into pans push back towards the connection for burner then push down into pan and forward towards feet holes. This allows burners to lock into place. I recommend based on my purchase this is a great product and fits whirlpool range WCF150,5
338461,42,"These were a great price and they do the job perfectly. Some of the filters I’ve purchased in the past from other sellers added a strange taste to the water. These are tasteless, but do the job perfectly. I will be purchasing from this seller again and I recommend for anyone looking to buy a quality filter at a great price.",5
463075,42,"My issue was that the blower motor would not stop.  This fixed my issue - a lot cheaper than a repair man.  Terminal matched up well enough to simply swap the thing out.  Just be careful, there's a lot of electricity in there.",5
606596,42,"It works! It's just time consuming, wish the process was a little faster. Cutting off the original foils, washing the pods, drying, filling the pods and then placing the foil and trimming as needed takes a while to do.",4
359292,42,The water filters were delivered quickly and I hope they are as good as the LG filters. I will just have to wait and see if they do the job.,5
652314,42,I like the EKobrew. It is easy to use especially since the cup holder of the brewer doesn't have to be removed.  One problem is that it doesn't clean as easily as the Keurig refillable cup.  Grounds tend to get stuck in the bottom of the cup.  I would recommend this product.,4
530988,42,This would have cost me $100 if I had gotten it thru an appliance repair organixation,5
62199,42,I am satisfied with my order perfectly. Thank you! 😊,5
160849,42,perfect fit into our refrigerator and water tastes great,5
44147,42,Item was exactly as listed.  It was shipped very quickly and the price was excellent!,5
304077,42,[[VIDEOID:4fb14cd8f2e32ce8209239854fd07c]] We purchased this for our RV that has precious little counter space. This is convenient countertop nugget ice machine that works. We also have a GE Opal nugget ice maker that is two years old and we liked it so much that we wanted another for our travel trailer and this unit is a little less expensive/more affordable.,5
231369,42,Ordered replacement gaskets for my hoses and received a piercing valve instead. Not a happy customer. Products are nothing alike I don’t understand the confusion. Would give 0 stars if possible,1
124779,42,"We purchased the dolly which makes it much easier to move around and could not be happier with this machine. No more laundromat and we can do laundry when we want... one load, three loads, our choice.",5
574414,42,Purchased these to replace cracked shelving in our 10 year old refrigerator.  Installation was quick and simple.  Can definitely recommend.,5
113596,42,"Made ice taste awful, almost like chlorine.  Do not recommend if you let ice melt in water, it tastes very very bad",1
245422,42,"Like another brand of this reusable k-cup, it will cause the coffee maker to get clogged with grounds if you don't regularly clean it. I highly recommend running plain water through after each cup of coffee made and weekly cleaning with vinegar or specialized cleaning solution.",4
165752,42,Took about 5 minutes to install and worked perfectly!,5
509551,42,Fit and looks just like the original shelves in my refrigerator.,5
261799,42,Five stars because it is as accurate as advertised and one simply can't beat the price. Perfect for my isopods and snails vivariums.,5
116372,42,"We were so excited to snag this ice machine during prime day. It arrived yesterday and worked great during the clean cycle and first time using the ice making cycle. We emptied the tank as recommended, and refilled to start a new cycle. This cycle was different. The machine made a noise like a ping pong ball was bouncing around inside, and no ice. We have tried it multiple times today and still the loud thudding noise and no ice. It now smells like it’s burning.. so bummed that it literally only worked for ONE cycle.",1
83018,42,"Study, worth the money definitely. I just got tired of sticky door handles.no regrets.",5
197035,42,"I filled them with coffee 3/4 full, and the lids won't stay closed. Impossible to store them in the k-cup rack",1
58605,42,"You may have to wiggle them around to get the Keurig lid to go down. I found that, probably since I grind my coffee extra fine for espresso, (but use my Keurig when I'm running late), I get a lot of dregs (coffee sediment) in my coffee when I use these cups.<br />I bought these to replace a different brand that stopped working (after a certain number of uses, the Keurig would leak water everywhere but disposable pods still worked). Hopefully these will last longer.",3
160342,42,We are satisfied with this product!,5
477857,42,great work out fine not as expensive as a kurig would have been,5
157131,42,"Super convenient, and lasts longer than the 6 months suggested by Frigidaire. Highly recommend.",5
650681,42,We placed this via the magnet directly on our dishwasher ! It's very cute and matches the kitchen perfectly. It's easy to read and move the slider.,5
15699,42,I thought this product was really cute it has some bubbles and it’s not a very strong magnet it’s so far i do like it,3
81501,42,First one began leaking after 5 months. (Hardline wouldn’t shut off)<br />Sent me a free replacement. Will definitely recommend.,5
442224,42,"Fantastic! Much cheaper than the name brand but fit just fine, no leaks or any abnormalities observed.",5
690322,42,"I bought this for a project thinking it would be like other low current heating elements — takes a while to warm up, then you can seal some things, then it's hot for a while afterward. This is not like that.<br /><br />The machine dumps a ton of heat in a short duration. The control knob does not control temperature; it controls time. Pressing the handle turns it on and it breaks its own circuit when the proper time is reached — perfect seals every time. It's cool to the touch as soon as I remove the bag.<br /><br />It seals every bag in my kitchen with a setting of 2. The highest I've gone is to 4 to seal a Mylar film. It goes up to 8; yes, it can seal that.",5
160799,42,Easy plug and pray part. Works great!,5
384084,42,"i read the reviews of several ice makers.  many posted they stopped working after 3 or four uses.  that has happened to me, but i always was able to restart it.  usually the diagnostic says empty, and it won't move from that.  it was frustrating, but after 20 minutes unplugged it worked fine for a hour or two then the samethng happened.  i would then unplug it for a10 to 20 minutes, shake it and it would work.  this leads me to conclude for my model/machine,the water intake line freezes and blocks water intake.  so i run the machine for about an hour unplug it to warm up the water line, the restart it.  it has not failed since.  it is good except for the water line issue.<br /><br />2-21-2017<br /><br />supplemental.<br /><br />there is a problem with the intake valve.  i discovered that rocking it front and back side to side will unstick the intake valve.  sometimes if it is stubborn, i have to pull the plug at the bottom to drain the reservoir, then rock the machine.  refill start the machine.  the valve usually un sticks and it works for a long time until the valve sticks again.",4
548292,42,Easy to install. Pricey but it works!,5
24245,42,"I had ordered two replacement parts like this one in the past, but they failed after about a year. This one appears to be higher quality, and I'm hoping it will last a lot longer.",5
128221,42,Lids don’t seal ..  don’t waste your money,1
130255,42,Could not install this filter. Followed directions and the filter leaked as soon as water filled it.,1
417091,42,Working properly and will likely order from this company in the future.,5
251484,42,Was the perfect part. Shipped same day. Had a working dryer. Didn’t last 4 months. Dryer stopped working this morning. Took it all apart and the wire on this part was just snapped. Not made to last!,1
14860,42,Product works great and looks great. Cast Aluminum scoop is a must though for breaking up the ice as it falls into the bin in sheets.,5
402813,42,This is a great replacement knob.,5
636215,42,This is a great price and it does what it says! I needed to check the humidity levels in our older house this was perfect.  Came quickly and I haven't experienced any issues.,5
129871,42,Lids kinda suck but they work,4
332393,42,Great water filter. Highly recommend. Will buy again!,5
446855,42,I couldn’t believe how much lint I got out of my dryer! I have taken my regular vacuum hose and tried to vacuum out the lint but this hose is amazing!!!  So I decided to vacuum out my air vents too.  I was even more shocked!  Be super careful doing those!!! You don’t want to mess up your duct work!!!  I would definitely recommend buying this!!,5
266130,42,I got this after I thought another order didn't work. It turns out I just needed some simple tips. Don't fill the cup completely full. Make sure the cup is tightly closed. This is great so you can use whichever coffee you prefer. I like the color.,4
550990,42,"Works perfect, almost in any brand name stoves",5
577,42,I love this thing in fact I'd love a second one,5

299223,42,"Bearings seem to go out regularly on this model of washing machine.  I have had to replace three times now.  First replacement lasted four years, second lasted six months.  The repair takes two hours and is a pain.  This bearing kit is not worth purchasing unless you enjoy replacing often.",5
227208,42,I purchased a pair of these to replace the broken ones on my refrigerator crisper bins. I wish these were made out of metal because the plastic seems to get brittle over time and break when the drawer is fully extended to reach the items in the back of the bin.,5

348427,42,I am very pleased with this product and it seems to be very accurate!,5
47726,42,We gave this to my niece as a present.  She likes it very much and appreciates having a permanent filter as opposed to having to stock paper ones.,5
601303,42,This kit helped out a lot. T<br />he dryer was not working as it should.,5
250243,42,"As described; solidly built and a quality product, but with anything, some flaws. However, if it were perfect, it would be in a museum. Lights were easy to install just push and twist, if you can't reasonably do that, we'll hire someone. Fan on low setting is quiet, high setting is a bit louder- you can still have a conversation around your gravy so no worries. I installed myself, but my wife considers me Superman so a mear mortal may need a partner, like Robin or Batgirl to assist.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy again and if you are on the fence, just jump off, into your neighbors yard and take a naughty swim in their pool; it will feel refreshing and considered a good decision.",5
71829,42,"The original, factory belt had deep 'ribs', that are made to engage the grooves in the drive pulley.  This belt didn't have these deep ribs, rather very shallow notches.  The belt was also about 1/2 to 3/4"" too short.  You can get it on, but it is a bear, and will ""max out"" you idler pulley.<br /><br />Here is a tip to help you put it on.  You're basically working though a hole in the back that allows one arm access.  So with one hand, cocking back the idler pulley AND trying to force a belt on that is too small.<br />There is a tiny hole on the idler pulley arm that aligns with another hole on the bracket when the arm when it is at full tension.  So you can stick something (like a screw) in that hole to ""hold"" the arm back allowing you to work with the arm cocked.  This leaves you with the only the task of stretching on the belt.  Then you can remove the piece from the hole, and the tension pulley will put back the pressure on the belt.",3

204895,42,Best thing we ever purchased for our house. Keeps the flys out of the house. Everyone loves it that comes by to visit. Very easy to install. Helps if you have a outlet 120 volt close by for the plug.,5

As for the longevity, I haven't had it long enough to know. So far, so good though!",5

I have a Keurig coffee maker at home, another at work.<br />I used these disposable cups with the Solofill grinder to make my own Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee cups, and it was wonderful!<br />These cups can be reused - I open them up, wash them out, and use a new filter for the next use.<br />Align the bottom hole in the cup to the pin in the Keurig machine when putting it in, and they're good for several uses each.<br />I have a septic system at home, and using a filter in reusable cups saves a lot of hassle cleaning (I don't want to wash coffee ground down the sink drain).  These are inexpensive enough that I can reuse them at work after I use them first at home, and don't have the hassle of cleaning out the other types of cups that use a metal mesh (and no paper filter).

116740,42,"Edit from 2016, second unit is NOT working.  This is a piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY!!!  May work for a few uses, but then it will stop working and just give absurd numbers that make no sense, even negative readings for example when you know they are positive.  Humidity, dew point temp, and normal temps are WAY off from where they should be reading, not even in the same ballpark.  I will be throwing this unit away.  Total waste.  Seems you need to spend a lot more to get a quality product.<br /><br />After receiving a second unit to evaluate it seems to be workimg much better than the first. Numbers seems to be accurate and I have tested it for a week or two now. I do see the numbers jump around a bit fluctuating a few degrees or so constantly but maybe that is normal as I have no other comparable device to compare to. In comparing it to my Ambient Weather station (which is supposed to be very accurate) for temperature and humidity it seems to agree pretty close. Perhaps the first unit was defective I don't know but this one seems alright. I still believe you get what you pay for, but for the price I guess it's alright.<br /><br />This is my original review of the first unit: After the first day it stopped working, stuck on 99.998% humidity or something like that, with dry bulb temps too low and wet bulb tempa too high, so ot was totally messed up, and I have no idea why. But for the first day it worked it seemed good. So I returned it.",4

518786,42,IMOROTANT! Do not just replace the thermal fuse. I thought my thermostat was working because it tested fine with continuity. Turned out it was faulty after burning out 2 thermal fuses in quick succession I thought I better research a bit more.

99245,42,"If you are unlucky enough to have purchased the previous version of these, you probably hate them as it took close to five minutes just to brew a cup of coffee.

I came on here to give that a 1-star review and found that the bottom was now flow-through so I ordered a set.<br /><br />Brewing a cup of coffee is much quicker now.  The best advice I can give is DO NOT fill it more than 3/4ths full.  Also, make sure you position it so that the opening to the reusable cup is towards the top of the Keurig and not the bottom. The angled nature of the cup holder is such that if you do fill it more than 3/4 full, you will end up with coffee grounds in your cup.<br /><br />If you have the previous version, throw them away and get these.  You will not be sorry.",5

555043,42,"We are very happy with this range.  Goedeckers did a great job with the delivery including choosing an endpoint delivery outfit that was very helpful and patient (we live in a rural area and we can be difficult to find--because it is gas they could not install it but they helped unpackage it and with the inspection, and took all the trash from the packaging with them).  I converted it from NG to Propane and found it to be straight forward.  I did have to purchase a new valve for connection to my gas line (not the fault of the range) and the recommended, new, flex tubing et. al. but that was to be expected.  The only caveat I have is that the location of the oven orifices is somewhat unclear as is the necessity of removing the burner tubes to reach them but once you understand where they must be, the rest of the installation is logical.  We have now been using this range for about a month and everything we've done with it has been great.  The flat racks for the top surface are very handy and because they are not slick, keep pans in place stirring, the burners work as advertised and provide an excellent range of heating to choose from, and the grill burner (and grill) work as expected.  My only caveat to use is that the burners do not seem to have infinite variability between high and low but tend to jump a several points throughout the dial rotation--the jumps are small and there are more than a half dozen so this has not been an issue.<br /><br />Update: We decided to reduce this from five stars to four because right around the two year mark one of the gas valves failed and had to be replaced at a cost of ~$45.  If I did not have the know-how to do this, it could've run into a couple of hundred or more depending on things like location, availability of discount for the valve, etc.  I've never heard of a valve failing.  For those who are interested, it simply wouldn't turn any more--after replacing it I took it apart and it was not a fault in the safety feature that requires you to push it in first before you turn it to on/light, after removing that part of the valve, the actual valve still would not turn.",4

486713,42,Great idea but doesn’t work perfect. I have this magnetically attached to my washer and used the magnetic included to attach to my door. Well the door isn’t a flat surface for this to grip to perfectly. I have to hold the door and give it a few seconds to attach and hold my door.

652990,42,I checked my washer first to see what the actual part looked like.  Ordered replacement as I think the hard water deposits were causing the valve to stick open sometimes.

The filters are not prone to the dreaded collapse while pouring water, ultimately a user error we admit, but easy enough to do when bleary-eyed, in a hurry, and not desirous of burning your non-pouring fingers while retaining the paper filter against the wall of your cone.  Slightly less expensive and possibly thinner, although rigorous measurement was not conducted in our laboratory, than another major quality brand beginning with the letter M, the only other acceptable filter.

101982,42,"We own an older version of this burner and it does a good job of providing a reliable source of heat for your pots and pans, but the knobs are poorly made.  After eight years of use, all four of the knobs have cracks in the bottom cylinders which fit over the metal controls in the main part of the heating unit; the knobs began failing two years ago.  If you do a search for replacement Bosch knobs you will find that other folks have had similar problems.  We filed a complaint with Bosch and their management team reviewed the photos that we sent and determined that because it had been eight years since we purchased the stove top that they would not be willing to provide replacement knobs. They best that they could do would be to offer us a 20% discount on the cost of the knobs which the sell for approximately $25 each. Given that the total cost of replacement would still be about $100 for four knobs, we declined their ""generous"" offer. I find it ridiculous that a major appliance corporation seems to feel that their knobs should not last more than six to eight years from regular use in normal conditions.  We take good care of our appliances and vehicles. I have a Kenmore washer/dryer set that last almost 20 years without any major repairs being needed. Sears makes some great knobs!  And I owned my last automobile for 13 years without it needing major repairs; Honda Pilot's are awesome.  So, if you don't mind taking the risk that the knobs on your appliance will fail after six to eight years of use, then this is the stove top for you. Otherwise, I would consider another brand.",1

I have been using it now for a long time, long enough that I can't remember any more, and it has lasted well.  A quick rinse, and you're done.  No complaints.",4
520712,42,"I got this for some extended travels over a few months where I will be driving from state to state, and will not always have access to a full size unit.<br /><br />What I like is that it works as described, and cleans my clothes. It's light and easy to move. The spin works really well and really gets the clothes almost dry, to the point I was surprised.<br /><br />For me, the downsides are; It requires a lot of user attention to get through a load or several loads. The spinner holds about half of what the washer holds, so after your first wash, you move half to the spinner and let it spin, then find a place to put those clothes while you load and spin the second half. then put them all back in the washer for the rinse, followed by a second series of the same thing...for each small load. That being said, I knew all that when ordering, and so it's more that I am disappointed after experiencing what it's actually like to wash with this, but they were clear about what I was getting. It would have been MUCH better to have the spinner of the same capacity as the washer. And even better if they were both the same thing, but they have those, and I didn't buy one because this was cheaper and more portable.<br /><br />Other notes are that when you start the spin, you have to hold the unit steady while it spins up to full speed. Once it's at full speed it's fine, but getting there involves a lot of vibration and it moves all around. Mine also occasionally makes a grindy/clicky noise for a few seconds during the wash. I hope this is normal operation, and not an indication of something about to break. If it does break, I'll update this. I'm not sure what the supply hose is supposed to fit on. Not any faucet or hose valve I have in my house or have ever seen for sure. Maybe something that is standard in Asia?? But I just fill it with a garden hose and that works fine, and is probably faster too. Finally, it's not exactly a water saving type of washer.<br /><br />BUT, like I mentioned at the start, I got exactly what was promised, and it should work fine for my needs. But it's not something I would buy for long term use.",4
368591,42,"I bought this to replace a 36"" GE Profile Radiant cooktop. I wanted gas; my wife wanted this. We got this.<br /><br />Installation was easy, as the previous cooktop had the same dimensions and wiring. That was a bonus for me.<br /><br />I wanted to find things about this induction cooktop that I didn't like. For example, my wife read that it boiled a cup of water faster than a microwave. I was skeptical.<br /><br />So, eager to disprove this bit of puffery, I measured out one cup of water and poured it into a vegetable steamer pot. Ready with my stopwatch, I pressed the on button for the ""burner."" I pressed High on the smallest cooking element on the cooktop and Start on the stopwatch simultaneously. Precisely 35.21 seconds later, the water was at a rolling boil! It made a believer out of me.<br /><br />We have experimented with settings for cooking different foods. Without going into too much detail, 4 or 5 covered most things. Even boiling water for pasta does not require the High setting after reaching a boil, unless you want it bubbling over!<br /><br />The downside is your cookware. I'm a huge cast iron fan. That's good, because they are perfect for induction. We find that our cook settings are always one level lower with cast iron than it is for any other ferrous cookware. Plus, even heavy cast iron heats up quickly on induction. We use silicone pads to keep the cast iron from scratching the glass. Works great!<br /><br />My wife likes her pots and pans light. Aluminum doesn't work with induction. No surprises for us there. What was surprising is how many stainless steel pots aren't true steel. We ran a magnet test. All save one of her lightweight stainless steel pots and pans failed. So did her aluminum with copper and steel cladding. Just not enough ferrous content for the magnet to stick... or the induction unit to sense a steel pot/pan. Guess who's wife just got new cookware?<br /><br />Cleaning is not hard. As the cooktop doesn't heat up, nothing cooks on. Just wipe the glass clean! The cooktop comes with a small sample of Weiman Glass Cooktop Cleaner and Polish. Take GE's advice: buy it. Nothing you've got under your sink will work as well. Everything else leaves streaks. Everything. Even water.<br /><br />Safety is what drove my wife to want this cooktop. The cooktop is not hot moments after we remove the pot or pan. If you, like me, counted on the pan remaining hot after turning off the gas or power to your burner or element, you'll need to use the warming element instead when you cook on this cooktop. The pan cools off rapidly once the power to that element is off, as the induction element radiates no heat.<br /><br />The only complaint that I could make is that the light gray markings inside the glass are too light to see easily if the glass is streaked.",5
598827,42,This item shipped quickly and fits well but tends to pop out if you put any weight in the bin.  I think it is more of a design flaw by frigidaire than anything else.  I would assume that the tabs on this one will break in time like the original.,3

595425,42,"I used this with my new fridge and it has been great- would like it to be more flexible and have a right angle connector but such a thing does not seem to exist. this feels fery well made. I used a syringe to flush with water before I even connected it and even pushed vinegar through it to help with any possible bad taste. When I hooked it up I flushed the system as recommended by Samsung and did not detect any taste other than clean water. The ice tasted terrible for quite awhile but the Samsung fridge is lined with the most toxic smelling styrofoam that is actually directly visible in the ice bin area so I think that is why the ice tasted so bad. I read reviews before that mentioned bad taste to the ice but not the water which made no sense to me but wonder if the ice bin itself is more to blame in those cases. Anyway, months later I am nothing but happy with this. I do think that flushing it first saved me some frustration but even if you dont, the smell will eventually go away.",5

I think the only complaint I really have is that it is a little bit flimsier than I expected. That might just be a personal preference as well, over all though its a great holder.",4

The ice maker doesn't work properly and leaves big clumps of ice burgs which freeze to the bottom of the ice tray eventually clogging up the entire assembly.  This happens on a regular basis - at least 3-4 times a day so now we have turned off the ice maker.  Luckily for us we purchased a used 1992 Whirlpool model last year for $25.00 at a garage sale that functions perfectly and makes fine ice.  I guess the Samsung Refrigerator wants us to get our exercise by making us walk to the garage every time we want ice.  I'm guessing the only solution is to replace the entire ice maker assembly, but will the next ice maker have the same problem?  Bottom line - Don't buy this refrigerator or any refrigerator made by Samsung.",1

285545,42,"Is it possible to hate an appliance?<br /><br />I bought this product from another provider.  The first unit I had delivered leaked and it took over a month to get Samsung to agree to look at the machine to find out what was wrong.  They finally found a dent and hole in the tub... they claimed it was damaged during delivery, but the location of the hole makes that impossible... it had to be damaged at the factory, before it was packaged, as the package was in perfect condition upon delivery.  Regardless, they replaced the unit... but it took a month!<br /><br />I've had this unit since September of 2014.  There are two pros to the unit, which is the reason I've given it two stars... it is VERY quiet, and it cleans very, very well.  Beyond that, it's a huge disappointment.  I always use the Sanitize function, so with heated drying, it takes 3 hours and 16 minutes minimum to complete a cycle.  Loading the unit is always a challenge... the tines that hold the dishes in the lower rack are very small and flimsy, and they constantly collapse every time I try to load the dishes.  They never hold our plates upright, limiting the number of dishes we can load.  The upper (3rd) rack just didn't work for us... we took it out after the first week, as it only prevented us from placing tall glasses in the top rack.  If you lower the top (2nd) rack to wash taller glasses, there's not enough space in the lower rack for our plates.  The baskets for the silverware are small and are lidded with flip-up covers with slots for the silverware.  Most of our silverware drops through the holes in the tops of the lids, which is fine.  But if you have to open one of the covers to wash larger items, use caution as the covers strike the side of the dishwasher block the rack from closing properly.  You can break the cover, or the rack will twist sideways when you attempt to slide it into the unit.<br /><br />Many have complained that the latch on the door doesn't work properly... in fact, the problem is that the top rack does not go all of the way in unless you're very careful and push only from the center of the rack.  If it doesn't snap in place, the door won't close completely, and the dishwasher will sound an error.  Likewise, if any item in the lower rack hits the door, you're likely to have a problem.  After finally working through this issue, we've not had any problems with incomplete cycles.<br /><br />I'm fortunate... I have a very large kitchen and we have two built-in dishwashers as we entertain frequently.  My other unit is a top of the line KitchenAid.  I no longer use the Samsung... my partner uses it.  If I hadn't paid so much for this thing, I would gladly rip it out and chuck it in the garbage.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",2

I am constantly having to turn it off and on. It will work for two cycles and stop again.

232596,42,"This is an update the review I left yesterday, upgrading the MaxBrew from 3 to 5 stars.  First of all, let me say that this company has OUTSTANDING customer service.  I contacted them regarding the fit problems and a live person called my cell phone within an hour.  The rep explained that Di Oro had to remove one of the notches (there used to be two) to make the filter work in the new Keurigs.  The notch is there to protect the filter and the piercing pin, so the piercing pin has to fit in the notch (you can see the piercing pin in the K575 in the first picture below; it's at the bottom).  The notch in the MaxBrew (at the bottom in the second picture) has to fit exactly over the piercing pin, or the top of the filter juts up and you have to use force to get the brewer to close.  It takes a bit of experimentation to get it just right, but if you put the MaxBrew hinge on the left and adjust it until you have it precisely over the piercing pin (third picture), it works great!  The customer service rep was very friendly, very clear and gave me advice on the carafe version of this filter, which I plan to order today.  All in all, a very positive experience.<br /><br />Öriginal review (3 stars):  &#34;Not a good fit for K575:  I just received my Di Oro single serving MaxBrew reusable coffee filter.  I bought it hoping it would be an improvement to the stainless steel EZ Perfect Pods we have which leave a lot of grounds in the coffee.  I also bought paper filter for the EZ Pod, but the one I tried made a terrible mess (no coffee grounds in the cup though).  While the coffee flavor using the Di Oro is indeed superior to the stainless steel EZ Perfect Pod, it takes a lot of adjustment to get the Di Oro version to fit correctly in our Keurig K575 and there are still a lot of grounds in the bottom of the cup.  I was thinking about purchasing the Di Oro carafe version of this reusable filter, but am afraid we may have the same fit problems?",5

One needs to run about 2 gallons of water through the system before the filter is really ready for use; there's gunk (probably charcoal dust) which needs to run through before it's potable.,4
432963,42,Product as described and great for organizing your fridge,5
226021,42,Exactly what I needed and as advertised.  Somewhat slow shipping - why isn't this Prime eligible?!?,4
535601,42,"These disposable cups are not a good design for the Keurig brewer.  I have used them probably 5 times, and my Keurig started giving me problems.  I had to basically take it apart and rinse the entire machine out because the water gets somehow backed up and the coffee grinds are everywhere.  I think that the plastic used for the disposable cups is too thick for the machine, and somehow the water doesn't get where it needs to go.<br /><br />Just trying to avoid someone else having the same problems.  Just order the k cups...it saves the machine.",1

662650,42,I bought 3 of these to use with my Honeywell HCM-890.  The humidifier won't work with them. Maybe they are too thick. I'm not sure what the problem is but I bought a new humidifier (same model) to test it and it didn't work with that one either.,1

Being the nice son I am, I bought the switch and installed it. My parents are quite happy with the light and my sister is very concerned that she may lose her share of the inheritance. She really should worry, as I’m the caring child who didn’t want them to be in the dark.<br /><br />The switch was easy to install and now my parents like me more than my sister.",5

The dots were blue and red, message them and they replied to give them my model number so the could tell me which to use.

407337,42,We ordered these coffee filters and found them to be short. We are getting grounds in our coffee every time we make it.  The filters are short so the water/grounds rise up over the filter level and we end up with grounds in the coffee.  They are probably only 1 cm short but it makes all the difference.,1

610435,42,I bought this for personal use and I love this machine. It makes two different sizes of ice and is very quick and it is not very loud either.

Try it and you will love it too.....☺,5

200049,42,"This review is a heads up to those that run into a similar problem that I did on install due to the prior filter tip breaking off in the filter dock.  At first I thought these didn't fit as the tip was a different size than the filter removed.  Once I realized that the the old tip was still stuck, I took a drill bit with a slightly larger diameter than the hole and threaded it in with a pair of needle nose pliers, then pulled it out.  Then the new filter clicked in perfectly.  After running a few glasses of water through  everything works well and tastes great.",5

190424,42,"I bought this Data logger to log temps for Freezers, Ambient Car Temp (in the summer) and various other applications.  Its very easy to use, Windows Interface works without complication for downloading and graphing Temp, Dew Point, Humidity.  Software only works in Windows, but will work under VMWare Fusion (or Bootcamp / Parallels).<br />This unit was bought used and but was in brand new condition (it appeared it had never been used) - very happy with this transaction and product.<br /><br />Only drawback I saw was when you download the data, it quits logging new data.  You have to reset the logger (and clear its previous logs) before starting a new log.  You can't ""spot check"" the temp and then return it to keep collecting data... other than that, its an awesome product.",5

499047,42,delivered and worked as expected.  easy to install.,5
253663,42,"Bought this for family gatherings. Ice is a good crunching texture. You’ll need a lot to cool a drink because the high surface area melts quickly (also better if scooped into the freezer for a bit), but it can keep up with 6+ people drinking beverages on ice all day long.",5
69515,42,Had an older range in a rental it looks great seeing clean coils and pans,5

551780,42,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these, but THEY ARE AMAZING! They are so much better than the loose-coffee attachment that comes with the Keurig. I don't have to fiddle with anything. I just open the cup, put my grounds in, shut it, and drop it into the Keurig. Super easy! I didn't have any issues with coffee grounds getting into my cup of joe. There are six of them so it makes preparing a couple of cups far easier. Nothing to complain about here.",5

The whole installation took about 3 hours.<br /><br />I was ready for the challenge and was successful, but please don't give this product bad reviews if you are unable to<br />use good woodworking skills to install it.

227496,42,The product came fast and was easy to install. When i went to use it for the first time it did not let any gas through. My supply pressure was 10 psi to the regulator. Apparently that is too much. If it has to be low pressure going into this regulator what is the point of using this one. If the details state what the max feed pressure is i missed it,1

312704,42,"I'm pretty mechanically inclined and with the help of the internet I determined this fuse was the cause of my dryer no longer functioning. After unplugging the dryer I removed the original part and ""hot wired"" the connectors together, plugged the dryer in, and it started right up. Local appliance repair stores in my area charge about $20 for the part and about $150 to replace it.<br /><br />  Taking the back off the dryer was the most time consuming part of the installation. Replacing the fuse itself took less than one minute, two electrical connectors and a small screw. The new part was identical to the original and functions as it should. It fit my Kitchenaid Super Capacity Plus dryer. Prior to the fuse burning out I was having to dry my clothes for one and a half cycles to get them completely dry but after replacing the fuse my clothes are dry the first time, every time.<br /><br />  A $6 part and about 20 minutes saved me from a $200 service call or having to replace my dryer. The seller even reached out via email to make sure that my issue was resolved. I received better customer service on such a cheap item than I have on much more expensive items in the past. I would definitely buy again and would recommend this product to anyone.",5

It was easy to slide the old part off and put the new one on but the new part slides right thru the groove and falls out into the door.

159867,42,This product comes with pros and cons..... Pros include: I love the fact this is an all mesh basket allowing for a more flavorful cup of coffee.  Easy to clean. Environmentally much better then the paper filters.  Now for the cons: The basket is super light weight I really do not see it lasting for long.  After a couple of times washing it has warped. I searched and searched the product description before purchasing it to see what size pot it was for and found none.  Being desperate to find one without a solid bottom decided to take a chance and order it.  For those wondering it is made for a 4 cup machine not an 8 -12 cup like I own.  If you have a small coffee pot this lightweight filter will work for you.,2

448191,42,"We got a nice bag of ground coffee and wanted to use it, but we've been a K-cup kitchen for so long that I needed to find a K-cup solution.  I tried this product - Breworo, and also the Delibru Reusable K-Cups, and the Keurig 119203 My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.  These Breworo k-cups were the winners.  I appreciate that there's a scoop included.<br />(Picture shows the Keurig 119203 on the left, Delibru in the middle, and Breworo - this item on the right)<br /><br />Brerworo K-cups (this item) - best<br />Pros: Water is forced into and not just on top of the grounds.  The bottom is solid, not mesh + the designs on the sides keep the coffee in a bit longer to develop the flavor.  The bottom has indentations to avoid contact with the sharp metal that pokes the hole in plastic K-cups.<br />Cons: Slightly longer brewing time (additional 10 seconds maybe? - the more you pack down the grounds, the longer it takes & more flavor)<br /><br />Delibru Reusable K-Cups - mediocre<br />Pros: Raised bottom to avoid contact with the sharp metal piece in the insert.  Quick brewing time is the same as a regular K-cup.<br />Cons: While the water is dispersed on the top like a rain head shower, the fact that it's mesh all around meant the water ran out somewhat quickly & the coffee didn't develop full flavor.<br /><br />Keurig 119203 My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter - would not recommend<br />Pros: Unlike the flip open tops on the Breworo & Delibru, this top screws on so it won't break off.  You need only one of these instead of 4 (backups?).<br />Cons: You have to remove the existing insert in the brewer and replace it with the one included on the filter... for 2 reasons, first is so there's no sharp metal point but also because you *must screw the top on* in order to safely brew! The first time I placed the filer basket into the insert & set the top on... huge mess of coffee grounds & water everywhere.  There is nothing that forces the water in like the Breworo so it just goes on top of the grounds.  This is open mesh on the sides like the Delibru but without the rain head shower to help soak the grounds, so even having a solid bottom doesn't help.  After multiple attempts, this best this filter produced was a quick cup of tan water.",5

583310,42,"My son turned me on to making a single serving of coffee with an Aeropress several years ago. While not as simple as plugging in a Keurig and pressing a button, the coffee that results is 10X better than the thin stuff than comes out of a K-machine.<br /><br />Wait, make that 25X.<br /><br />Aeropress is designed to use a small paper filter that is disposed after each use. They're not expensive, but can be a bit hard to find in the local stores. Amazon sells some reusable metal filters and they work well too. But along comes the Trobing Airflow Valve Filter system that combines a metal filter with a unique base that has a tiny opening for the brewed coffee to pour into your waiting cup.<br /><br />That tiny opening is the difference between normal Aeropress coffee and this brew. It acts somewhat like an espresso machine in which coffee is forced under pressure through the grounds. And, somewhat like an espresso machine, you get some foam - almost crema - on the top of your coffee cup.<br /><br />So does it work well?<br /><br />Well, you're not going to think you just ordered an espresso at a coffee shop that uses an $8,000  La Marzocco espresso machine. But you will find a very nicely brewed cup of coffee that somehow tastes stronger than a cup brewed with stock Aeropress parts. The foam bubbles that the Trobing Airflow produces are larger than the tiny bubbles that make up true espresso crema, and they don't last as long either. But this device is really cool and makes great coffee.<br /><br />A few watch-outs:<br /><br />- first, read the directions! Trobing suggests pre-warming the Aeropress and your coffee cup with almost-boiling water. Do this! Then drain the Aeropress and add the coffee, then more almost-boiling water. And wait. Wait a bit more. It's worth it, even in a Keurig world. Then press that Aeropress plunger down and smell the difference between real coffee and fake machine coffee.<br /><br />- second, the key to the Trobing is the tiny rubber valve in the center of the base. It comes out, and if you're not careful, it could disappear when you clean out the Aeropress after brewing. Trobing thoughfully includes a backup valve in the box, but lose both and you're back to using your stock Aeropress parts.<br /><br />- last, the metal filter that Trobing uses only correctly fits into the base one way. If you can't easily lock the base of Trobing on the brew chamber of your Aeropress, then you have the filter in upside down. Flip it around and you'll know what I mean.",4

It doesn’t yet change my views on these machines but if it lasts longer than the other two, I’ll get back on here and let you know.<br /><br />The GE ice machine cost more and had worse reviews, and here’s my ice maker status. About a year ago, I bought my first Chinese ice machine by “Taotronics”. Within about 4-5 months, it began making a loud, terrible screeching, grinding sound, stopped making ice…and was no longer to be found Amazon, I.e., a clue. Of course just outside of the return window, I made the decision to look for a “better” ice maker.<br /><br />Found one! The “Gevi”. Extraordinarily similar, but with way better reviews and a good price. So, why not?! I’ll tell you why not. SAME EXACT PROBLEMS plus two. Within the same time of ownership as the Taotronics, this one not only makes the terrible noises but add to the list that it decided twice to leak all over the countertop, ruining paperwork and greeting cards and rusting a metal-lined basket into the quartz surface.<br /><br />And the picture of the metal washer-looking pieces? These were in the water bath below the ice just a couple days ago. Lovely.<br /><br />Time to increase my spend expectations because I will not be fooled again. I sure hope this review deters you from similar looking Chinese pieces of crap. Good luck.",1

I make more ice ahead for my cooler on long trips or short ones to the park/beach. It's even fun to watch the little waterfall that makes the ice. It has all the features you would want.<br /><br />Pros:<br />small footprint<br />does not need water hookup<br />automatic cut off when full<br />makes ice quickly - about 15 minutes/cycle<br />ice falls into tray in layers which maximizes what it will hold<br />low power consumption<br /><br />Cons:<br />a little loud for camping, but just turn it off when not making ice (you can hear it in the video)<br /><br />Now this is a next level item for preppers. Who else will be making ice when the power is off? One nice thing about making ice is it can be moved to your cooler to help preserve your perishables.  The low power consumption is a plus, so it does lend itself to a prepping/off grid scenario. I hate to do this, but I am giving it just a 4 out of 5 because it should be on your C or D list as far as priorities.

Since the box says what is in it, you dare not risk leaving it outside unless you want someone to take it home with them, ""Look, honey, a new freezer! Let's pull up and load it into the car.""  Anyway, the listings for how much it holds are GREATLY exaggerated. It holds what your normal fridge freezer holds and NOTHING more than that. It is the exact same amount of interior space. So I moved the big turkey into the bottom. The turkey barely fit in, but did with some finagling. It is NOT a large bird. So I'm moving most of my meat in here, though I can't find container that will fit it. I thought a dishpan would work but it is TOO SMALL TO HOLD A DISH PAN. Just know that. Right now I'll just put the food in fabric grocery bags and at least that way it is sorted (beef, chicken, vegetables, fish) so I won't have to get in and out of it too often. Do NOT get the 3.5 size, get at least the next size up, 5.0. I didn't because the cost was out of my budget. I'm grateful to have a freezer, don't get me wrong, but had I ordered a month ago, I could have gotten the next size up for $30 less than what I paid for this scrawny freezer. Oh, the weight: 42 pounds, not 48 as listed on the description. The height is about counter height, less than 2 feet wide, less than 2 feet deep.

So simple that a 5 year old could do it. That part was easy enough, except it didn’t work! Well, okay, Amazon is great about returns, so all I had to do is remove it, except that turned into a Herculean task! Once it was in, it wouldn’t come out! I was afraid it would snap if I used too much force. That’s when I could have used that 5 year old’s favorite superhero to help me remove it! After careful effort, and much frustration, I got it out, but the bottom line is it didn’t work! But even if it did, when it came time to replace it, it would not have been worth the effort.",1

I have had the hood of the wall for 2 months waiting for the company to send replacement. I live in Alaska and now they do not deliver to Alaska. This was after I ordered the cheaper brand hood from AKDY and it was delivered to me I plugged it in and it wouldn’t even come on straight from the factory.

LO MEJOR es la aplicación es Smart Life, la aplicación es muy completa para crear escenas<br />5. funciona perfecto con Alexa y Google Home, tengo los dos asistentes en uso<br /><br />LO NEGATIVO<br />1. creo que a futuro sacaran un modelo mas pequeño, aunque lo que es actualmente es muy bueno<br />2. agregue 2 televisores, una caja digital de canales y 2 aires acondicionadores lo malo es que no puedo cambiarles el nombre, no se puede editar los nombres y se llamas TV y TV 2, es algo incomodo aunque la verdad eso no te afecta en funcionalidad, pero si tienes muchos aparatos puede ser problema, no se si este problema es general o puntual en mi caso<br />3. agregue un aire acondicionado Comforstar y me da problemas, tiene 2 grados abajo en su configuración, le digo pon el aire acondicionado en 22 grados y me lo configura a 20 grados, hoy intentare en borrar y agregar nuevamente la configuración, espero se resuelva<br />4. tengo una barra de sonido y un teatro en casa y no tienen controles para estos aparatos, no es problema ya que puedes grabar un mando, pero ocupas que funcione el mando para grabar el botón<br />5. el teatro en casa de sonido que tengo es algo viejo y el mando a control remoto se daño, no tengo el mando y como no existe este aparato en su catalogo no puedo agregarlo, este es un impedimento grande ya que si el mando esta dañado y no esta en el catalogo de aparatos creo que sera difícil que puedas agregarlo, debería existir una opción para descargar aparato y ampliar tu catalogo<br /><br />el aparato es funcional, es potente, lo pones en una esquina de tu habitación o sala de estar y te accede a todos los aparatos cercanos, no necesitas colocarlo frente a los aparatos a controlar, yo los tengo a varios metros y  escondido y funciona bien<br /><br />debes ser creativo con los escenarios y puedes sacar mucho provecho, ejemplo en la mañana enciendo el TV y la caja digital, luego configure un canal de música y configuro el volumen del TV y apaga mi aire acondicionado, es tener creatividad, al inicio hice la configuración en Alexa y Google, pero es mejor crear la Escena en la App del aparato y solo ejecutarla con los asistentes<br /><br />muy satisfecho",5
96399,42,Direct replacement for the original.  Simply unscrew the old one and replace with the new one.  Larger tab prevents installing wrong. Just remember to run a glass or 2 of water through the system first to remove the carbon. Water will be gray to black initially but then clear up.,5
423889,42,"Let me start with the pros. This oven is really nice to look at. That's where the good ends. Don't be fooled by the ""commercial-esque"" aesthetics. I bought a home with all brand new Thor appliances, and they have all been AWFUL (but back to the oven).<br /><br />During COVID, we've been cooking a lot more than usual. The oven started tripping my electrical breaker any time we went to use it. Burners were fine, broiler was fine. I had an electrician come out to check the breaker and my house wiring was fine. Must be the oven.<br /><br />I find out that the igniters in these ovens can go every 6 months to a year; so I bought an official Thor replacement through a local distributor. Because of COVID, I wanted to do the repair myself (the less people in my house the better).<br /><br />I opened up the stove today to do the repair, and what I found blew my mind. The gas burner inside the stove melted over time because the glow bar got too hot, and actually started FLOWING UPWARD INTO THE IGNITER!!! The reason my breaker was popping was because the gas burner was shorting against the glow bar! What a safety hazard. I could have burned my house down because of this.<br /><br />How does a product with this type of failure even make it to market?! Aside from this; we've had issues with the front right burner not igniting properly, and the knobs on this thing get HOT. Like, insanely hot.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor and spend the extra money if you want a real commercial style range. In dealing with Thor service and support for another appliance I had of theirs in the past, they have not been competent at all. Just save yourself a headache and buy something that's not made by this company. In fact; Thor doesn't even make these things. They buy from large scale suppliers overseas and glue their logo on.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.",1

98516,42,I'm currently using the first of 3 sets of filters. All seems very good at this point but I still need to find how well they last. With our temperatures ranging from below 0 to mid 20s we need moisture added to our indoor air. We use a furnace unit plus a stand alone unit for this. we keep things around 45%. These filters are in the stand alone unit add the last 10% of this amount. So far they are working great.,5

139463,42,"We have wanted a ""Sonic Ice"" maker ever since we discovered there was such a thing.  This little 44Lb ice maker fits the bill quite nicely.  Simple to use, nice looking and makes great little nugget ice quite quickly.  I ran the 15-minute cleaning cycle first (as recommended), then refilled it and pressed start.  Within 15 minutes it was spitting out little ice nuggets that were perfect for munching on.  Within 60 minutes the basket was about 1/2 full.  I would think this could keep up with ice for a half dozen people or so pretty easy.  More than that and I would plan ahead and make a bunch of ice ahead of time.<br /><br />If you have any ""Hard water"" issues like we do, I recommend using filtered water in this machine so it doesn't get any calcium buildup.  Having it next to the refrigerator makes it very easy to draw filtered water from the dispenser on the fridge door to refill the ice maker, no need for a separate filtered jug or anything if you have that convenience.<br /><br />The only drawback we have found is that it is fairly noisy when it is in the process of making the ice.  But like any other ambient noise, once you run it for a bit you get used to it and don't really notice it anymore.",4

656449,42,"Good freezer, though I think the instructions need to be better... It seems that when the freezer is set to MAX, there is some kind of quick-freeze setting that is not mentioned in the manual. With my freezer, I set the temperature to MAX on the initial use, because it is hot out here in the desert, even in the middle of winter. The freezer refused to go below 10 degrees with about 4 gallons of water inside. In fact, it would go down to 10, then drift back up to 20, before going back to 10.<br /><br />I moved the freezer, thinking it was not getting enough airflow, and it did the same thing, after testing for two days, I shut it off. The next day, I turned it back on, but only set it to medium. With a few hours, it was at 0 degrees, and by the next day it was below zero.<br /><br />I think the MAX setting must runt the compressor constantly, then cycle the compressor off after a while to avoid overheating it, while the lower settings can turn the compressor on and off at will.<br /><br />Again, this was not mentioned in the manual, but another brand of freezer I have has a similar setting, so I should have known. (Should be stated in the manual though.)<br /><br />I did let the freezer stand for over 24 hours before using it to avoid problems from shipping, though the manual only recommends 2 hours. That seems insufficient, and I would recommend at least 24. Also, the manual states that &#34;too much food&#34; can cause the freezer to run inefficiently. Yes, if packed too tight to allow airflow, i think this is true, but the fuller a freezer is, the better it operates in my understanding. Later it warns against adding too much warm food at a time, which is a separate case.<br /><br />In any case, the manual could use some serious improvement, but the freeze itself works great..",4

Most portable washers in this price range are pretty sketchy, so I was skeptical of this one working that well.  Now, understanding that its capacity is going to be very limited, this thing works well, and efficiently.<br /><br />I was able to get everything to work with all of the equipment straight out of the box.  The feed hose is short, so you're going to have to move the thing close to your sink unless you fashion an extension yourself out of Home Depot parts.<br /><br />It did have some water in it, as others have noted.  I highly doubt they only test 2% of these.  That said, the water was not rancid or moldy, and there was absolutely no smell emanating from the washer.<br /><br />I've run about 20 loads in it so far and it has washed the clothes flawlessly.  It will be running a long while - about  2 hours.  You'll also want to be careful with the drain hose, as the force of the ejecting water can cause it to move around a little, just make sure it's secure wherever you place it, and pointing into your drain.<br /><br />If you're in an apartment without a hookup, I would very strongly suggest this unit.",5

The selection of the 30&#34; models was not as great so I purchased the Cosmo even though I hesitated because I did not want to clean the glass & stainless steel.  I've learned to spray the cleaning cloth and not the unit.  Plus the glass in this model helps to not dominate the room. I made the perfect choice - the lights and 3 seed fan work great!",5

633546,42,"Most reviews are done early in the ownership lifetime of the appliance.  Here’s a longer run view of the design flaws that exist in LG dishwashers.<br /><br />I am replacing my high end LG dishwasher after less than two years of use.  The dishwasher failed due to a cracked fitting on the water intake which failed during the night and caused about $10K in damage to a kitchen hardwood floor, and to drywall and carpeting in a finished basement.  This was not the first problem with this dishwasher.<br /><br />While the LG dishwasher never cleaned as well as the GE dishwasher that it replaced, over time it has become apparent that it has a number of fundamental design flaws.  The drain path has several cavities where water and food can accumulate.  As a result, the dishwasher began to smell after about a year of service.  Food became trapped in the drain path and even though I used a pressure washer to try and clean out the sump and drain path, it was impossible to get it completely cleaned out and the smell persisted.<br /><br />A second, more disastrous problem occurred this past week.  The water intake valve failed completely and water out overnight.  By the time the leak was discovered in the morning it had destroyed a kitchen hardwood floor which also into a finished basement destroying carpet and drywall in the process.<br /><br />I wish that I had checked the reviews before buying this product.  LG is ranked across the internet as the least reliable dishwasher on the market.",1

106230,42,"My dryer has about a 25 foot run but has 4 right angle bends along it’s path.  Rule of thumb, adding 5 feet for every right angle bend, makes this equivalent to a 45 foot run!  After a few years my wife was complaining clothes weren’t drying and she had to run them through 3 times to get them dry.  Decided to clean the vent duct.  It was clogged and packed with lint.  How to clean out a vent duct like this is another story.  Anyway, decided I needed to add a vent fan and bought this one.  The dryer is in our mud room on the first floor with no space or good place to put this fan.  Also, wanted this fan far enough away from living space so the noise it makes isn’t annoying.  The dryer duct goes into our unfinished basement and then, through a crazy route out the back of the house.  Found a good spot along the duct run to mount the fan on the underside of the first floor joists and luckily it was close enough to an existing electrical outlet that only a short extension cord was needed to plug it in.  Now the question was how to turn it on and off without having to go down to the basement and plug or unplug the fan.  The fan comes with a current sensor that probably works great but wiring it in my situation means running new wire through the wall from the mud room to the basement and a little knowledge of how to do it.  The instructions that come with the current sensor are minimal but other posters have supplied helpful information on how to hook it up.  Anyway my simple solution was to use an Alexa compatible plug.  I named it “dryer vent”.  I plugged it into the outlet in the basement and plugged the fan into it.  Now when we use the dryer we just say “Alexa, turn on dryer vent” and when the dryer is done say “Alexa, turn off dryer vent”.  I also set up “routines” in the Alexa app for timing the fan to turn on and off with one command.  Example: “ Alexa turn on dryer vent for 30 minutes”.  I made a few different routines for different times ( 30 minutes, 40 minutes, one hour, etc.)  Granted, using the sensor is seamless but the way I did is much simpler especially if you aren’t comfortable messing with electrical wiring.<br />  As far as the fan itself goes,  mine came with a dent in one of the round openings where the vent tubing connects.  I was able to straighten it out using a pliers.  Not perfect but not a problem.  The length of the round openings where the vent duct connects could be a little longer to ensure a secure connection but it does work.  The fan does make a far amount of noise and I wouldn’t recommend placing it an area where noise would be annoying.  The fan itself does work very well and the drying ability of our dryer improved dramatically.",4

I did this at full force for perhaps 45 blows to get the nut off; after 4-5 blows I figured I would just have to destroy parts and replace them.  In this process this wrench did not cause any undue damage to the nut, only a few dings on the contact surfaces of the engagement points - in fact I reused the nut temporarily while waiting for new parts.",5
403479,42,She loved it perfect size fits perfectly on the counter next to the coffee machine,5
555842,42,Arrived quickly and it was all that I expected.,5
315108,42,I have a Kenmore Elite HE3 Dryer and this set worked perfectly. It's back to being factory quiet. Highly recommend.,5
699650,42,"Very expensive.  Adds $100+/ year to the cost of the frig. Over 10 years that’s an extra $1,000.  Next time I’ll take that into consideration when buying a new frig.",4
552647,42,This product seems to work exactly like the LG model at a fraction of the cost. So far so good,5
369649,42,this came broken and we are trying to find the return code to return the broken one. we received the new one.  i can not scan code on my phone. what can i do to return it?,1
683205,42,"I purchased this to go along with the Broan PM390 Power Pack. I highly recommended the insert to make the unit look “finished”, easier to clean and protect the surrounding wood surface.  The price on Amazon, when combined with the Power Pack was the best I found.",5
135464,42,Little shorter than pictured so it only covers half of the handles on the frig but great quality and they look great.,4
412747,42,"Bought this for camping, had to test it out.. works great.. Did not have a spin cycle, but a cloth line works great... Does a great job.  Easy to use, easy to store.. I am happy with it... Hated going to the laundry mat while camping....  I wouldnt put jeans in there but tee, socks, and undies would be great...  save money.....",5
323144,42,"So far, so good. Price is worth it compared to purchases I have made in stores.",4
248961,42,"Perfect fit....""LQQKS"" as good or better than the Original!!",5
117606,42,"They item fit the refrigerator and it’s flavor is good, but it could use a better enhancer flavor",4
284884,42,Great value and quality but measurements matter... had to rerun these because they did not fit my gas stove. Quality and device were great but for me they had to be returned,3
46824,42,Good to clean the surface of the lint catcher but expected it to go farther into the tube.,3
470156,42,I bought it for a room I rent it's perfect,5
409354,42,"I don't know if we got a defective unit or what, but while I expected our bill to rise a little, I was NOT prepared for a $75 spike in March and a $100 spike in April! We thought it was turning on and off too often, so we lowered the temperature from 4 to a three. It is probably 2/3 full, but even if NOT full as some electric companies may suggest, there is no reason on God's green earth for our bill to go up $75 and $100!!!! This weekend, we are buying big bags of ice to keep in there with our food and will give it another month. We've missed the return window of course so we may have to dispose of a $255 product. Needless to say, NOT happy and do NOT recommend this freezer.",1
536106,42,The new version of these are awesome!  The simpleCups for 2.0 with the purple lids are VERY hard to close! These were far superior to those! I will be re-ordering these instead!,5
681586,42,THIS IS AN EXACT REPLACEMENT SO IT FITS PERFECTLY  PRICE WAS MORE THAN FAIR,5
499967,42,It works great. Hard to install because it's a dryer belt. The only real complaint I have is that it stinks real bad. I open the dryer door and it smells like a skunk just walked by. I've done about ten loads and it still smells the same.,3
86120,42,WERE much thinner than expected and than the compactor bags purchased from Home Depot.  Holes develop easily in these.  For the same price the ones I horn from Home Depot were way better.,3
139709,42,"The icemaker on my GE gbsc0hcxarww refrigerator stopped working some months ago.  I had tried quite a few things, including trying to reset it via the flap on the icemaker itself, letting it defrost, turning the water off and on--all to no avail.  Having to buy bags of ice was a drag.<br /><br />Finally bought this unit.  It was super easy to install.  Turned off the water, pulled out and unplugged the refrigerator, undid the cover, and was able to remove the valve and install the new one quickly.  Used a towel but hardly any water came out.  Didn't even need to cut the old tube to the icemaker.  This also was a great chance to clean all the dust from the back.<br /><br />Finished up at ~10p, and wasn't sure if it was working.  Checked at 12:30a and saw a single cube.  SUCCESS!  Verified next morning more cubes (thrown out in case it was stale), and have been getting plenty of ice since!",5
616561,42,Works great- much cheaper than name brand and works just as good<br />Water comes out clean and tastes great,5
164467,42,"Very well made, highly recommend! Comes with 4 screws to secure in each corner! Screen behind the vents is perfect to keep anything from crawling in when air is not coming out of it! Easy to install as long as you get the cut right, I bought the [[ASIN:B00005LEZR B00005LEZR]] to be sure the first time! And I'm glad I did, perfect cut and size and the intake hood slid right in with no gaps or issue's to speak of!! 1 cut, 1 fit! All around happy with this buy!! Thanks Amazon for another great online purchase!!!",5
303008,42,This is a great little ice machine! Makes ice quickly! I had a different super expensive machine that died right after the warranty ran out so I ordered this one. Very happy with this machine and the price!! I did buy the extended warranty just in case.,5
584149,42,Product arrived in a timely matter n it does its job thank you,5
679155,42,"Purchased to have on hand. Have purchased before, very satisfied.",4
484088,42,Exactly what I wanted delivered on time.,5
547927,42,This product is not the same size as the original piece. It does not fit in the nook made to hold the scoop. DISAPPOINTED!,2
561919,42,I ordered these for my new Kuerig 2.0 brewer.  They work great!  Delivery was very quick!,5
406125,42,These work so well I don’t know if I’ll go back to regular K cups.,5
9300,42,Went right in/perfect fit! Nothing beats OEM parts... Works like a champ. Machine is like new. Note: We were using powdered Oxy Clean and I found my failed pump was caked up internally with it.  Surely a direct cause of failure. Switched to liquid!,5
615502,42,The shredded to pieces in two months<br /><br />I want my money back,1
634792,42,I have been looking for an affordable ice maker that makes cubed ice. The quality and ease of this product is a 10. Thank you,5
540979,42,No regrets. Easy install can't tell the difference between the brand name and this one,5
502477,42,We are very happy with this product and the price was fantastic!,5
46270,42,The water runs through these so fast that little flavor is extracted form the grounds. I used the strong setting and made a 6 oz cup; this is still a very weak cup.,1
608694,42,"Brand new in the box, Universal for 50 and 60 CPAP models. Thank you!",5
679744,42,Love these! Don’t know why anyone wouldn’t want to use these over the wasteful one cup pods. It takes me 5 seconds to fill with my favorite ground coffee and it actually tastes better and stronger. Save $ and waste!,5
685523,42,Didn’t realize I would have an expensive fridge bill,1
55355,42,"Knob does not fit stove , sits way too hi. It is the right size knob however it has a built in stop on the inside causing it to sit up to high. Unable to use",1
552707,42,"Nice stuff, the firts days its a little harder to filter the coffe, but them start to work very well. Go green.",4
265488,42,"I have had my dryer vent well over one year.I love it.The vent works well.The vent doesn't fit in the newer model energy efficient window frames though.I have not had any problems with my vent being compatible with my magic chef 2.5 cu. ft. dryer exhaust or the dryer itself the whole time that I have been using the vent.When my dryer vent was delivered over a year ago,one side of the vent box was completely crushed and unfortunately so was the entire vent on that side.I had to get a thick bath towel and pliers to try and straighten the vent out and put it back to form without making it worse.Thankfully. I was able to.Vent still working perfectly after all this time.Due to my immediate need of the product and the cost,I simply reformed the vent,instead of trying to return it.Great product for apartments that don't have dryer hook ups installed in them.",5
655064,42,very easy to install longevity not sure just got not too long ago hopefully last and price was right,4
244096,42,Will take care of whole house,5

499788,42,This filter does not fit my Maytag refrigerator and now I need a repairman!,1
371461,42,"Worth the money! I think the price is fair for the quality of the product<br />These are ""think"" metal drip pans either<br /> Very polished and beautiful<br /> I'm glad I found this set, it's difficult to find a set that has a large and 3 small pans. Please doing business with you all!",5
670633,42,"Other on line places I looked at were twice as much plus $shipping, so great on price.  I didn't look at the instructions but they looked detailed.  It's much easier to look for a video on YouTube and you look at it once and it's easy to remember.  I like that there are metal components that will hopefully make it last longer but for the price if it breaks again it's not the end of the world.  Now the real concern.....the adjusters don't seem to want to stay in the ""raised"" position which might make it sit too low if I have the wrong stuff in the bottom rack...just put it on today so we will see.  Overall decent purchase",4
286269,42,The instructions are bad but you figure it out in your own. This is as an upgrade for me from another portable washer that separated the spin cycle. So this saves me so much time to not have to partition the clothes to spin them out.,5
116175,42,"We have had this product for almost two months. So far it has exceeded our expectations. We did exactly as the mfg. suggested.  We made sure it sits level on the floor, we turned it on and let it cool for 24 hours before we stocked it.  So far so good.  It is relatively quiet, and it does hold all different size bottles.  We are very pleased with this product.",5
97711,42,just received today and washed ONE load in a 5-gallon bucket & ONE in a 17-gallon tub!!<br />it is a MOST IMPRESSIVE clothes washer!!!!! i love it<br />the agitation is strong in both containers!! BUT GENTLE on the cloths- more like a front-load washer than a top-load!!<br /><br />it is a little noisy- a little lower than a Vita-Mix Blender noise! so not too bad in my apartment with a neighbor next to my bathroom wall!! BUT if you have no neighbors next to your wall- it is NOT something that would bother you in the next room- if my neighbor complains i will just put it on the patio!<br /><br />it also does splash a little water out so it needs to be in a bathtub or outside! not so much splash that it needs refilling but just enough to make a mess on the floor<br /><br />this last year or two i have been using a plunger for agitation in the same containers- which works good but this is so much better- a couple of minutes at 1st- then let it soak and later come back to agitate 5 or 10 minutes more and the wash is done- then draw rinse water and agitate a few minutes-- i have a HIGH-SPEED-SPINNER which gets 95% of the water out so hanging 2 or 3 hours they will dry and ZERO DRIPPING!!,5
646708,42,Just bought this light bulb socket to replace the socket in my GE Freezer and it was easy to take out the old one and replace it with the new bulb socket.  New light bulb seemed to be working great.,5
41335,42,"Works as expected, does a great job of keeping scraps,liquid, etc, on the counter and not falling between stove and counter.",5
442456,42,I give this 3 stars only because there is only one setting for the light.  We liked to keep ours on in the kitchen over night.  Not with this one.  Only one setting and it is BRIGHT!  Almost too bright for even cooking.,3
412519,42,They fit just fine but the first time we cleaned them the printing smeared.,2
688011,42,Arrived overnight and so easy to use. And let’s not forget about the awesome price.,5
118977,42,"I am actually using two of these traps together, since one would not really trap lint properly as its holes are not fine enough.",1
285662,42,Disappointed.  Doesn't come with tray bottom as pictures. Not with the price.,1
442702,42,Love it!!! Easy quick and absolutely great,5
556134,42,These filters are not properly sized or fitted. They are off by a hair in size so it will likely fall off. Very disappointed.,1
672000,42,Overall it was good . but my draining hose a lot of leaks and leaking water. Can u send me a replacement ?,4
162388,42,"these things are so easy to use , and dont leach any plastic chemicals into your coffee. I would buy again.",5
697990,42,"This heating element is exactly the same (packaging and everything) as the one available on the GE parts site and several other on-line parts stores, but at a lower price.  It was relatively easy to install (and you should know that I am retired woman, not a handyman type).  Dryers are fairly simple machines, easy to repair.  Now my dryer should last for a few more years.",5
122365,42,"This is a good part, but installation can be tricky.",5
190316,42,These save me time and money since I go through them like water. The number I received was cheaper than going to the store to buy them every month.,5
220236,42,"Well shoot, I ordered the wrong size filters. I don't even know what kind of pot this size filter fits. They are cuter than dangit though...I don't know anyone to give these to, but I will keep them on hand, and spread the word, I'm sure I will find someone soon. I will still give them 5 stars, for the filters are still great.",5
35857,42,Not much to say except they cover as expected. My stove top is black so it matches very well. Easy installation. But I had to improvise for my long burner (used two) but overall it covers so hopefully it will help keep my splatters fun ruining the top.,5
323459,42,worked as intended and was delivered on time,5
223146,42,"Fixed the problem in my Maytag MDB7759AWS dishwasher.  Installed easily and no additional parts needed.  Did need to uninstall the dishwasher and remove from underneath the countertop, as you need to access the back to remove the nut holding the heating element in place.  Lots of videos on YouTube showing you how to install it.",5
385923,42,"I ordered two pair to replace both the front and back rollers.  Using a youtube video as a guide, the entire process took a little less than two hours to complete.  By being patient and taking one step at a time, the job can be done by a novice.  This includes time to thoroughly clean inside the dryer cabinet.  The dryer now runs as quietly as it did when it was new.  I estimate that ordering the parts and providing my own labor, I saved at least $200 over calling an appliance repair shop.",5
644909,42,We've had this cup for a couple of weeks now and do not recommend it. It's the same brand I've ordered from Amazon before but doesn't have the &#34;screens&#34; on each side for the water to seep through so there's too much pressure and it can be messy. Have had plastic in the past and think I'll stick with those.,1
306877,42,Worked great for tent camping with trying to keep supplies to a minimum. Does take a little work to get the netting part clean with just a bucket of water at the campsite but worth the trouble. Better option than instant coffee.,5
519832,42,Professional grade hood moves a large volume of air. Has built in damper so no need to buy special vent. Highly recommend!,5
610862,42,Works perfect with my Cuisinart pot.,5
491831,42,"Not sure what the ""upgraded version"" is bringing to the table, this looks exactly like the part I was replacing.  Excellent fitment.  Easy enough to install, if you are this deep into a repair, you must have a decent idea of what you are trying to do anyway.  Price was good, and received part quickly after ordering.  Hoping this will outlast the rest of the wash machine now.",4
118743,42,"Not cheap at all, but it worked in my LG Fridge. I had to use my roto tool to mod the &#34;trough&#34; where the water comes in.  But after that, it worked perfectly.",5
660479,42,"Easy to install and they work great. At this price,  they work flawlessly.They are just as efficient as Keurigs. Kudos",5
533920,42,"This thing is awesome, but I think its off a little because i found myself having a very hard time maintaining the humidity and needing to replace the velcro in the back from general wetness that sticks to the glass walls of my tank.<br />Id give it less stars, but im not sure if the maintaining humidity is the products part, or mine.",3
619772,42,I really like theses k cups. The off brands leak.,5
66011,42,"Everything is good so far, I like the way it knows when to stop and making more.",5
222210,42,"The OEM part was $250, this part was $25 and looks just like the original and it is works great.  It took me 2-3 hours to install it. You will need a good instructional video.",5
569752,42,We use these in a std 12 cup coffee machine.,5
200947,42,I have been using this product for sometime and it works great. I use it on my keurig and my drip brew. You can’t go wrong here.,5
538792,42,"My very fine Kenmore 90 Series dryer quit running after almost 20 years, and after a few online searches, I knew it was the motor.  I considered just buying a dryer off of Craigslist, but decided that for the same price, or less, I could get my nice one running again.  I've read several reviews of this replacement motor...some say it's a cheap knock-off, some say it is the real deal.  I am here to tell you that this is definitely the real thing.  The box clearly states that it is a Whirlpool part, and the part number shown matches up exactly.  The wiring for the broken belt switch was changed, but it wasn't that hard to figure out, and instructions were included.  I was able to install the new motor using some youtube videos and my dryer is once again purring away.  You can buy this one with confidence!",5
